Currently at around 130 hours, I may not play that intensively anymore, but it's still easy to play it for a few hours straight. I realized that if I mute the in-game music and put Spotify on, then it's a much more enjoyable experience. 

Never thought the game would be for me, a real surprise. I like playing poker, but kinda hate roguelike elements in games in general - the idea of ""runs"" isn't really that appealing to me, not sure how to describe it better.

I love Soulslikes and FromSoft especially but the idea of a melee-combat game where there is essentially one single way to play (parrying, in this case) really sucked for me

I love Elden Ring (&gt;1100 hrs and counting) because you can play it any way you want with its build variety; sword and board, two-handed, weapon-arts, parry build, bow and arrow, sorcery-melee, sorcery-ranged, incantations, and so many more. You can play the game through 20 times and still have new playstyles to try

You should be warned that getting platinum in Skyrim is not for the faint of heart. I did it on 360 but swore I'd never do it again. In particular the following achievements are very grindy:


• kill a legendary dragon


• restore the thieves guild to its former glory


• get all werewolf perks


• get all vampire lord perks


• build 3 fully upgraded custom houses


The first one is deceptively difficult because it requires you to reach a very high level (75 I think)


The second one is extremely grindy because you have to do 4 or 5 mini thieves guild jobs in each city and manually keep track of your tally for jobs in each city with a pen and paper; I would reccomend looking up a guide to explain this better


The 3rd and 4th ones require you to kill like 300 enemies as each of those beast forms


The 5th one requires an enormous amount of shopping and harvesting to gather all the materials to build the houses


You can technically get every single achievement on a single playthrough but you have to know what you're doing.


For example it is possible to softlock yourself out of ever being able to become a werewolf or vampire lord again. With the achievement for getting all the daedric artifacts, it is impossible to get this if you choose the wrong endings for some of the daedric quests (which in many cases are the morally good endings). With the dark brotherhood achievements, it is impossible to get them if you side against the dark brotherhood (which, to be fair, is very unlikely for you to do by mistake).",2025-06-22 06:55:56-08:00,fenian1798,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz5u96w/,2

I then learned that this was just the first run and that completing the game meant I would have to play through the same thing but higher difficulty each time... It just wasn't fun at all. Mostly for the same reasons that you listed and then also that I guess I'm not a big fan of those hack and slash type of games. Part of the reason might be that I played with a keyboard instead of controller although I play all games with a keyboard. I would've quit earlier but I didn't have any other games to play at that time. I might try it again when I have a controller but right now it's just not fun at all.,2025-06-22 06:30:36-08:00,Moss-y-,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz5ph64/,1

I told them about this and they kind of laughed and said ""yeah, at the lower ranks it's like that. it gets better as your rating goes up""

I just couldn't get into it. Like I said, I don't really like sandbox games, and it was just too open ended for me. After an interesting intro, I was sent out into a big map that was mostly empty. I come across some interesting looking settlements, but mostly they just have some side quests along the lines of asking me to kill some rats. Eventually, after some hours of wandering and random side quests, I find my way in the direction of the main story, and I'm presented with what seems like it could be a consequential choice. But it isn't really, the dialog options don't really seem to have much impact on the conversation, and I'm not really able to give the response I wanted to. I return back to home and I'm presented with the option to start doing base building. I decide that the game is not for me.

The same also goes for Blue Prince. I'm only a few hours into it (around 20 days) but it felt like each day was the same as before; lay down rooms, go as far as I can, get near the 46th room, run out of steps or only draw rooms without an exit in the direction I wanted, start again. I know there are things I need to do that will permanently unlock things. I've tried to go in as blind as possible, but in my frustration I read something about the torches in the cave and I know I can upgrade rooms if I get a disc and a terminal (done that once) but, as with BotW, it felt like each run I'd make barely any progress and it was getting to repetitive.

you basically get a quote saying you talked about stuff but you dont actually get to see the vast majority of what that dialog actually included. it is beyond insulting and really hurts the depth potential of the game.

dialog options are pretty reduced too. later on navigation becomes a bigger issue when you cant even draw a map from your own explorations ala most other games.

then there's the point where in act 3 you've done what you need to and more of the world opens up to a high degree of damage and health sponge. that burned me out.

and for me for whatever reason I had to deal with random crashes on zone transitions. could play as much as i wanted while in a zone but any attempt to leave or go to a new one oculd cause a crash. i encountered alonfside my friend over 100 crashes.​

538,gaming,mz67uql,t1_mz5niuc,"Rust.

My best friend LOVES that game and everything about it. Base building, mining, journeys to the oil rig, EVERYTHING! It’s hard to put my thoughts to words on this because it’s a love/HATE relationship from me. On paper, I should love the game almost as much as him, but there’s something about it that gives me that “numbing in the mind” feeling that you get from death scrolling, and it’s weird because it almost instant. The most obvious answer that I can pull from my thoughts is the risk/reward being the issue since other players can grind and raid you offline, but that’s also just an accepted part of the game. Sometimes I think it’s the grind of the game, gradually getting to full weapons, armor, etc…, but the grind is a big part of what makes it fun. Maybe HOW long it takes? I hope someone can help me put this to words, I know there are others out there that feel the same way.

Since I’ve obviously played a lot of Rust and didn’t just drop it right away, I’ll briefly explain: I promised my friend to give it a chance and “bounced off” after the first weekend of 8+ hour days. He fell in love right away and for the first time ever in our friendship and gaming lives, he joined a clan and started playing with a small crew of people within, again LONG ass sessions. When your best friend loves a game that much, you sacrifice your time and try to make the most of it, even if you kind of dreaded logging in some days.",2025-06-22 08:05:48-08:00,Nightman2417,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz67uql/,1

If you don’t like this then it’s whatever, im not trying to argue you into liking it. I’m just pushing back on the idea that the enemies are sponges, they only are if you refuse to play the intended experience (optimizing lumina). 

I don’t really think that’s anything crazy to say. If you play all of ff7 without leveling your materia and you do the final boss fight with all level 1 gear and materia then it’ll be a sponge too. Because you’re not playing the game the way it’s intended.

In fact, I’d even argue if you’re not optimizing lumina you’re not playing the game as intended even in act 1-2, you’re just moreso cushioned by the damage cap.

608,gaming,mz6y1q1,t1_mz6ot0m,"I mean it’s their opinion, but I know a lot of people agree with it, including myself. So much of ‘difficulty’ of Lies of P comes from one gimmick that it recycles over and over which is the animation feinting into a jerky attack. As in, the shoulder and elbow of an enemy will move as if attacking, only to stop for a moment and then suddenly do an extremely fast attack. So you’re not reacting to the actual attack animation, but instead memorising the timing of the bullshit feint attack. This is completely different to Sekiro which has fluid and intuitively readable attacks. 

As well as that, the distance closing by some enemies is obnoxious where if you move far away from an enemy at the start of its attack animation, it will lunge abnormally far to catch you at the end of the combo. 

I’m saying this as someone who has 100% Lies of P, Sekiro, Soulsbourne, and AC6, as well as SL1 runs on the Soulsbournes. I’m no amateur but this design philosophy is just poor.",2025-06-22 10:16:25-08:00,PREDDlT0R,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6y1q1/,6
609,gaming,mz76ahv,t1_mz6y1q1,"I mean I'll concede that a few enemies in Lies of P have some awkward moves. The axe-wielding puppet in a white suit near the beginning of the game, and the big marching band type puppets are probably the worst offenders in my opinion.

Alright so you claim Lies of P has ""artificial difficulty,"" in the form of attacks that have awkward timing, right? So where is difficulty \*supposed\* to come from? Genuine question. Because I think most people would agree that Sekiro is a difficult game. Where does its difficulty come from? Enemies do too much damage? Player doesn't do enough damage? Too many enemies? Enemy attacks difficult to time correctly?

So isn't all difficulty artificial? In Sekiro, you could be like ""wow that enemy killed me in two hits. The devs set their damage output too high to create artificial difficulty."" But I guess the damage is high because the player was supposed to parry the attack, and the high damage is the player's punishment for not reading the attack and parrying. And you're saying attacks are easier to read in Sekiro than Lies of P. Therefore Lies of P must be the problem.

In my opinion, if you take a hit in Lies of P, it's less problematic than taking a hit in Sekiro. So even though it may be harder to time a parry in Lies of P, the punishment for failure is less severe. Furthermore, in Lies of P, you don't have to parry most attacks. You can hold down the guard button, and then regain your HP by attacking the enemy in retaliation. So that's another way that Lies of P is easier.

Lies of P may have some enemies with awkward attack animations, but that doesn't make the game clunky or bullshit. If it was clunky and bullshit, then I wouldn't have bothered beating the entire game without leveling up.

I initially didn't think I would like it, but I kept going because I loved the art style so much. And then I fell in love with all of the movement mechanics and exploration there is to do.

If I had to change one thing about the game, I wish there was just a sign or something at the beginning to let players know that they can pogo jump. Until watching a YouTube video, I did not understand how the mechanic worked, so I missed out on a lot of things at the beginning.

634,gaming,mz8n3n9,t1_mz6i9e2,"Here's the original post Pt1:  
I want to point out that I'm playing on the highest difficulty as I usually do and I've not yet completed the game, but that's also partially why I'm writing this, because I currently lack the drive to do so (and not because of the difficulty). Which bothers me because I almost autistically 100% every game I start playing and I do WANT TO like this game. But 40+ hours in, so far I've had a miserable experience for at least as long as it's been fun. The sound, looks and design of the world and of it's inhabitants are top tier, I don't think anyone can find a fault in these, except maybe for the too many colorful visual effects in combat but with the whole painting aesthetic the game's going for, while I don't necessarily ""like"" it, I do think it fits. But what the strong aspects did for me, was making the misteps in other aspects even more glaring by contrast. The game's combat is one of them.

**The gameplay:**

The main fun in JRPG's simple combat have always been finding ways to break the game, which will still end up making it boring after a couple of hours, but at least it makes you finish the game in less time. To try to lessen staleness of the gameplay, the devs usually introduce new systems at certain points in the game to shake things up a bit, which hopefully also lead to the optimal builds shifting. Back to Clair Obscur: The devs' version of the JRPG combat furmula makes enemy attacks not only completely avoidable with the right input timing (which is already a rarity in JRPGs) but it also generates you ""mana"" AND can launch a counter attack for some damage, that can even hit flying opponents. This not only makes any abilities or pictos focused on taking hits obsolete, but also lessens the value of healing and defensive stats by default. The highest difficulty makes some enemy attacks oneshot you, while most take you below half HP. As most regions only have 3-4 types of enemies, usually with 2-3 attack patterns and you respawn at the last enemy defeated/item looted. Even if your team gets wiped out at an enemy a couple of times until you learn to perfect dodge everything, this hardly feels like a punishment. Every character can resurrect another using a consumable item that recharges at checkpoints, which costs a character their turn the same way if they used a heal. Since you have 3 characters active at a time and if one is dead and the second one is resurrecting them, you still have one more character dealing damage to enemies, which makes the occasional death acceptable as you're still getting closer to victory.",2025-06-22 15:43:22-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8n3n9/,5
635,gaming,mz8n5us,t1_mz6i9e2,"Pt2: Since healing is used on a not-yet downed character and only draws out the combat's length on the assumption that you WILL take another hit and since even being full hp might not protect you from oneshot moves that happen above a certain difficulty, heals are also generally not worth having on the highest difficulty. And even if by the offchance you do need healing, you can just pop a few of the consumable heals that recharge at checkpoints. Is all defensive ability inferior to pure offense then? No. Armor protects you from all damage. Late chapter 1/early chapter 2 (I don't exactly remember) you can get a picto that gives your character 2 armor if a hit takes them to low HP. If your characters were getting two-shot, this doubles their effective HP. As long as you have enough health/defense where you don't get oneshot by most moves, you can start pumping stats into offensive attributes for the most value. The puppet monkey character can also use abilities that give one or more teammates armor, making him much more valuable in the support role than Lune with her heals, which are not even worth leveling. But speaking of heals, why do we even need them? Why not go one step further, equip the lumina that makes you take -50% damage (further reducing the amount of points you need for survival) at the cost of being immune to healing, while also equipping the lumina that increases your damage while making you Inverted (healing deals damage to you), which is not a problem since healing has no effect on you anymore. Combine this with the fact that you have 3-8 charges of resurrection, which means you technically have that many plus the number of characters amount of chances to make mistakes even in the worst case scenario of enemies one-shotting a character (AoE moves shouldn't oneshot if you're properly leveled for that region). Pretty soon, by building optimally, you'll be able to take out enemy lineups within one rotation before they can retaliate. This, however, also makes the game more boring, as the dynamic part of it (the parrying) becomes infrequent against anything other than bosses and minibosses. To reduce the staleness, you'll find two new mechanics midway. One is the introduction of the gradient attacks, which requires a new input to defend against. Except they hardly matter, as not only are they really slow, but the parry window from your input also lingers WAAAY longer than a normal parry. The only times I got hit by them were because they're so infrequent, I legit forgot they existed a couple of times. Not only would I consider introducing them a failure in this regard, but they also led to some of my most frustrating moments, more on that later. The other mechanic was present from the start, except the player couldn't know about it: The player's damage is limited to 9'999 per tick (yes, I know what you want to say, more on that later). This does shake things up quite a bit first it becomes relevant because it suddenly turns the high scaling, single hit attacks inferior compared to multi hit ones, changing up which ability is worth using and which isn't, while also limiting the maximum possible damage the team can put out in a single turn. I was originally in favor of this, but what ended up happening was only further limiting the viable strategies: Maelle, who felt mediocre after Gestral Village already compared to the rest of the cast (yes, even Gustave), became straight up bad as her fire damage amp became useless, burn's max damage became the same as any random counterattack, most of her damaging skills were only 1-2 hits, she had only a single hit AoE attack and her offensive stance became a straight up disadvantage with no upsides when you're already consistently hitting the damage limit. This made her only useful for her taunt ability, which could, theoretically, allow me to sacrifice what little defense I built on the others and lean even further into damage, but there was little point to it when I'm already consistently hitting 9'999. So, by late chapter 2: Tanking abilities (outside of Maelle's taunt and armor) are near useless, healing abilities are useless, attacks with 1-2 hits are useless, burn is weak, damage buffs are useless, crit is less and less useful, Maelle herself is bad and since fights are starting to get more and more drawn out because of the damage limit, the foot fetishist monkey's main use is more and more so about being a shieldbot for the team. Weapons wise, Verso and Lune are perhaps the only ones where you have a wider variety of viable choices instead of one or two options far overshadowing every other choice. Scielle is exceptionally guilty of this, as the weapon which makes her apply max Foretell can be acquired early on and trivializes all other weapon options and some of her foretell applying abilities as well.",2025-06-22 15:43:45-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8n5us/,5
636,gaming,mz8n8m7,t1_mz6i9e2,"Pt3: There are two reasons I spent so much writing about the gameplay. 1: I firmly believe that for any game, gameplay should be the main focus, with the narrative used to enhance the experience, despite most games in the last 10 or so years doing the exact opposite, focusing on narrative and making the gameplay just servicable enough that the player can endure it until the story's finished, at which point they hopefully have a good enough impression of the game where they want to play the next one in the series but don't want to stick around with the current one instead. 2: Because the combat gameplay is what you're going to do for the majority of your playtime.  
The other major part is exploration, which is as basic as it gets. There are no interesting puzzles (barely any puzzles at all) and most map layouts follow the same logic, just with a different paintjob. I also have a strong dislike for these kinds of maps because, as dumb as it sounds, the more freedom the designers have, the more it stifles creativity. When you have a limited space to navigate like Resident Evil 2's police station, the map designers have to consider the size of the building, the location of rooms, the ways different rooms open into each other logically, what items are supposed to be where, where should they put shortcuts to improve navigation etc. It takes a lot more thought and skill to create those kind of maps than putting a bunch of colorful, flying rocks in the sky, implementing magical grappling points between them, scattering some colorful balls along the corners as items and calling it a day. What makes these maps the most impressive to look at will make them the most boring to explore.  
I find the transition between exploration and combat also pretty jarring here. JRPGs have been doing this transitional method for the genre's entire existence, but there used to be reasons for it. Smaller screens, limited pixel count, limited memory, engine limitations, hiding loading screens. Just because it always worked like this, doesn't mean it's good design. Except now it's considered ""traditional"" in a genre that's almost as opposed to innovation as the Pokemon company. It can be a ""me"" problem, but I found it jarring that whenever I roam in the game's overworld map with my beautifully made, high definition characters that are giants in these low poly vistas, only to get in combat with an enemy that transitions me to a completely different spot on the map as an arena, with everyone standing still in a set distance, characters jumping 5 meters in to attack, hitting an enemy then jumping back. The Yakuza series, despite being a really well acted but mostly badly written character drama, out of nowhere ended up making their last 2 mainline games JRPGs and with each entry improved on the realistic feel of the combat more than any game since paper mario, with characters dynamically walking around the room, sizing up and taunting each other, kicking objects out of their way or even grabbing and using said objects during specific attacks. Just because a game is turn based and formulaic, it doesn't have to FEEL turn based and formulaic.",2025-06-22 15:44:12-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8n8m7/,4
637,gaming,mz8naty,t1_mz6i9e2,"Pt4: **The animation:**

This is another thing I feel mixed about. Once you have your build, you're likely going to keep doing the same ability rotation on your side of the battlefield, which makes the dynamic part of the combat - that keeps things interesting after 10 minutes - the dodgin and parrying you have to do, as that changes with every enemy. My first problem animation wise is that, instead of leaning into Sekiro style animations that are easier to read, they decided to lean more so into Lies of P territory, meaning that gravity, enemy mass, and even the speed at which time passes are only rough guidelines and not so much preestabilished rules. An enemy the size of small bus does a 180° sweep with the speed of sound, followed by another one that seems to drag like RuPaul. I understand they did this so that players won't be able to dodge/parry everything before they learned the timing, but I disagree with the decision. A game like Lies of P or Elden Ring mainly utilizes this system with bosses' movesets, which are the main draw of the game as they don't want players to beat those too fast. Clair Obscur's normal enemies are often just there to waste your time if you don't run past them. Having the satisfaction of being able to read normal enemies' more cosistently wouldn't have made the game worse. What does make it worse however, is the inconsistency of these attacks' hitboxes. Sometimes, a slam will deal damage when it connects with your head. In another enemy's case, it still looks like it passes through your character's body but nope, the shockwave from slamming the ground under your feet is when it connects. In some cases you have to parry a sweeping move when it'd hit your side character, other times it's when it hits the middle one. There were at least two times when I was conistently messing up gradient attacks' timings. One of these was for a chromatic enemy I spent over 30 minutes fighting that you have to constantly counterattack to stun. Turns out: Despite it looking like a gradient attack, sounding like a gradient attack, having the delay of a gradient attack... it was a normal attack that had to be parried by a normal parry input. This pissed me off. How the f\*\*\* did this go through testing?!  
When it comes to non-gameplay, sometimes the animation is stellar. Other times, characters look like Mark Zuckerberg imitating human emotions. This would be fine, as these must be done with an animation rigging system since they probably didn't have the time / permission to mocap these. My problem however is, what they CHOSE to mocap. Random cutscene in the middle of an area where they're just looking around, saying and doing absolutely nothing of consequence? Mocapped. Camp scene where one character is supposed to be distressed while the other is trying to console them? This is where you'd need mocap to actually use the facial and body language of the actors, except we get two Zuckerbergs staring at space toward each other. Huuuge missed opportunity.",2025-06-22 15:44:33-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8naty/,4
638,gaming,mz8ncug,t1_mz6i9e2,"Pt5: **The writing:**

I honestly think that the writing is by far the worst part of this game, so much so that I don't care about any of the current characters. Most dialogue between characters is servicable at best, but the only characters who were closest to having something resembling a personality so far have been the chick who dies at the start and Gustave who... yeah. In over 20 hours of gameplay, what I learned about Lune and not for a lack of trying, is that she loves Gestrals and likes following rules because she's unsure of herself. Scielle had a husband, was a farmer, can't swim (this never became relevant). The puppet monkey is there to speak cryptic stuff in a cool voice and do deadpan comedy. Maelle is a feisty teenager with a mysterious background who throughout the story became my second least favorite character with how oblivious she acts whenever a dream sequence/flashback happens and boy do they happen way too many times, often with no new information conveyed about the secret of the house. Even before chapter 2, it was possible to put together that she's some kind of reincarnation or painted version of Alicia, who's either the daughter of the paintress or the paintress herself. Meanwhile, Maiev the 3rd time seeing her doppelganger: ""ShE lOoKs LiKe Me..."" Speaking of my least favorite character: Verso. I f\*\*\*ing hate this guy. One part of it is a ""me"" problem: Many, many years ago, when I was still just a young teenager during FF7's golden age, I used to daydream about a self-insert imaginary character of me in FF7's world, who replaces Cloud as the MC, have a short beard and white hair on the side of his head like Reed Richards ('cause I thought he looks cool), is a total badass and the coolest character, acts like he has a dark side and did things he's not proud of and despite all this manages to get close to all the girls in the team. Verso is this, pretty much word by word, except he's a self-insert from one of the writers. If he had a Katana it'd be pretty spot on to what childhood me used to daydream about, and thus I'm having second-hand embarassment every time he's on screen. What made this even worse is the way they introduced him: Esquiere name dropped him once, which nobody questioned and that was it. A guy, who supposedly lived for over a hundred years, went back to Lumiere (unless he's lying) and has been known to join other expeditions as well, and NOBODY in our team ever heard or read of him, not even in previous expeditions' journals we found throughout the world. Then the way he appears right after our previous MC dies just to use the same skills, stats and weapons he had and more, and how everyone immediately trusts him to lead the expedition is the gaming equivalent of the writer yanking your favorite toy out of your hands, just to put another one in it that you've never seen before because he thinks this is better. That Chapter 1 ending might be my most hated scene right after the Joel's death from LoU2.",2025-06-22 15:44:52-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8ncug/,3

640,gaming,mz8ni49,t1_mz6i9e2,"Pt6: And the main reason it pisses me off is because they didn't set it up at all. Things they could've done: Introduce Verso's name in multiple expedition journals you find earlier on, so that after listening to them, your characters start talking. ""Who's this Verso? He was mentioned in multiple journals as a member, but these are 40 years apart, how is he still alive?"" Have the Gestral Villagers namedrop him as the guy who was the previous champion of their tournament. Put an engraved message that warns you of dangers, by a cave in one of the early areas with a Chromatic Nevron inside, only to find out one area later in an journal that it was written by Verso for future expeditioners. Build him up as this mysterious good guy, so that when Esquiere namedrops him, the team can actually react to it, and maybe even have our balloon friend tell the tale of one of their adventures. Instead of going to the area where Gustave dies because Esquiere left his rock there... supposedly, have them go there because Esquiere left his rock with Verso ""so the rock can take care of him"", so you're trying to find Verso. Gustave having his ""last stand"" against Renoire also felt like a time waster for me, with him throwing his life away for no reason and the team not helping him because the writer randomly brought back the boss that we' just beaten. I refuse to believe they couldn't have climbed back up even without the magical elevator power they climb everywhere in the time it took for the cutscene to play out. Another change that could improve this would be that after Gustave gets shot in the back, have him fall off the cliff into the water. Lune can jump in the water to save Gustave from drowning. Meanwhile, have Scielle watch helplessly, because SHE'S AFRAID OF WATER, as they already set it up earlier, and Esquiere can't do much with the scared frozen Scielle on his back because like he said, he can't fly with cargo. Gustave gets resuscitated once Lune fishes him out onto Esquiere, and Verso shows up and saves Maelle. Once they get away, later in the camp, have the wounded Gustave - who's no longer fit to fight and will be carried by Esquiere between camps - be the one to tell the rest to trust Verso as he already protected them from danger, with Lune being the pessimistic one and Scielle being angry at herself for almost letting Gustave drown. These changes would make the change of main character less jarring and out of the blue, with new chances to build character with dialogue that's not just talking about their feelings. Hell, they could still kill off Gustave later.  
Speaking of the dialogue, many of the more interesting dialogue cuts out with a black screen summary right as they'd get interesting. Imagine if you got a black screen in Mass Effect with the text: ""And then Thane told Sheppard how he reconciles his deep spirituality with his violent profession."" Another huge missed opportunity for character writing. The chroma magic system is barely explained. (What are it's limits? Does more chroma make you more powerful, or can you call on more chroma the more powerful you are? Can you do anything if you have enough chroma? Does it have a drawback to use too much of it?) Whenever there was a cutscene with combat in it, I had 0 stake in it because since the magic system and power scaling is not explained at all, the writers can take the story in any direction they want with no thought put behind it's execution. They aren't limited by what they set up previously, since they... barely set up anything at all.",2025-06-22 15:45:43-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8ni49/,5

The game did everything to set this up as the big ending. It had the reused areas with higher level enemy gauntlet bit that many RPGs do right before the final boss when they ran out of development time, money or both. I, of course, stopped to kill every enemy because I like to 100% games and I don't know which one will have a rare drop. It took hours to get to the Lumiere part of the area, and at that point my friend who was watching me play said ""how the hell aren't you bored of this?"" to which I had no answer as I was going off of pure determination at this point rather than enjoyment. Then, after the banner checkpoint right before the paintress, the monkey says something like ""once we go up there, there's no turning back"", clearly stating to the player that this is the point of no return right before the end. So, what did I do? I teleported out of there and went out to do everything I haven't done yet. I beat the icy mountain area, the giant Nevron in the sea, everything that I could access. With 9'999 damage limit. Some bosses took hours. Some normal enemies took 5-15 minutes. It was horrible, but I wanted to 100% the game, and I didn't want to go New Game+ because I knew I wouldn't be able to convince myself to go through the early areas again with how burnt out I was by everything. The flying stuff? I thought that's accessible in New Game+, otherwise why would the monkey say that was the point of no return when an area is still unaccessible? I decided to leave the paintress to the next day. Then the next day, when I was telling my colleague about it, and he said: ""You know the Paintress is not the end and there's a whole another chapter afterwards, right? And that the damage cap gets removed?""

... And this is where I am now. Did I make my bed? Yes, to a degree, but I put half the blame on the guy who designed the map / dialogue at the end of the chapter.",2025-06-22 15:46:01-08:00,Crystoff,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8njxm/,4
642,gaming,mz8nlt7,t1_mz6i9e2,"Pt8: Understandably, I lost all motivation to finish it, but to be honest, even before that, I was already on the fence about the game. Like, everywhere I go, I hear someone say how this is one of the best games ever made, and I'm sitting there like, how? It IS beautiful and has a nice unique soundtrack (other than the second overworld track which I muted when I started seriously exploring the overworld map for secrets as I grew tired of hearing the characters' names being yelled in french over and over again for hours as I'm running in circles). The combat, while decent, is nowhere near the best JRPGs have to offer, the characters are shallow (as of pre-paintress fight), the worldbuilding is almost nonexistent, the writing is questionable to say the least and have so many missed opportunities that it's painful, with the MC swap being a slap in the face. The exploration is basic, the map layouts are basic, there are no interesting puzzles, the balance is all over the place (as of pre-paintress fight). Compared to most of the sh\*tty games the AAA business spits out daily? Yeah, it's much better (I know it's AA). It's good. But that's just it, ""good"". Not great, not amazing, and certainly not a once-in-a-lifetime experience many people claim it to be, unless they really have so little to compare it to. I honestly don't know if I'm the one not seeing the thing that makes it so great, or if it really is just a more passionately made, real pretty but shallow game that due to the beatiful sceneries, emotionally driven (tho badly written) story and emotional music successfully manipulates the general gaming community into thinking that they're witnessing something amazing when it's the game version of an ""oscar bait"".

677,gaming,mz6270n,t1_mz5nlp3,"Oh man, The Witcher 3.

I should've loved that one, it was right up my alley. 

I *looooooove* medieval fantasy in general, some of my favorite games ever made are Dark Souls 1 &amp; 3, Divinity Original Sin 2, Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, Dark Messiah, Elden Ring, Breath of the Wild, Blasphemous and Baldur's Gate 3. Hell, I love KCD1 &amp; 2 with all my heart, it's why I'm in this sub in the first place.


I love everything about TW3 in terms of atmosphere, artstyle and music.

I consider the soundtrack to be among the best ever made.

Hearts of Stone was easily the best part of the game, the storytelling was freaking excellent there.

So why didn't I love it?

Everything in the game mechanically *fucking SUCKS.*

That combat, man. 

It's *outrageously* terrible. 

Very simple too.

Lack of variety in The Witcher 3's combat is only part of the reason why it feels so bad.

Normally, if a game has simple combat, it would be polished in a way that feel makes that combat system feel more fluid than combat systems that prioritize variety over fluidity, right? 

As an example:

Dark Souls took advantage of this. It doesn't have the best combat variety out there and it's pretty simple, but it feels really nice and weighty. 

The Witcher 3's combat doesn't take advantage of having little combat variety it has in favor of polish like Dark Souls does.

It's like CDPR didn't even try to polish it, despite what little you could do with TW3's combat.

The janky combat animations are still present.

The combat flow isn't what it should've been due to how slow Geralt moves in his combat pose and just how prominent animation lock is.

There's a lot of broken hitboxes that make dodging feel pointless and is likely the reason why Quen is so overtuned. Quen is a band-aid for this.

https://youtu.be/jsCWy5wUs04

An example of the hitboxes. This has happened to me hundreds of times during my playthrough, and it still happens to this day.


The crossbow is very unresponsive and misfires all the time.

The health bars of enemies are generally really spongey.

The fact that the heavy attack does *marginally* more damage than the light attack, is way too slow to use for the amount of damage it does and literally has no benefit to use it over light attack.

Some attacks don't land because the attacks that Geralt uses are entirely decided by how far away he is from an enemy and some of the attacks that he ends up using aren't designed with this in mind or have way too small hitboxes to be viable (damn backwards poke attack), as opposed to what Dark Souls does:

In Dark Souls, every weapon has a specific combo and *nothing* but that combo. When you press attack, it *only* progresses through that combo. 

In Dark Souls, the first attack is always the same.

The second attack is always the same.

The third attack is always the same.

The heavy attack is always the same.

Parrying is always the same.

Weapon arts are always the same.

The player decides when to use them regardless of distance. It's entirely up to the player to maximize their combat potential.

It's very reliable compared to the weird distance based attack system that TW3 has, which more often than not makes you attack the enemy right next to the enemy you want to attack.

It is not uncommon for Geralt to choose to spin around for like a full second before he swings his sword and instantly die mid-spin from an enemy, instead of just simply swinging his sword in half the time it takes to spin around.

In Dark Souls, you can predict enemy attacks and act accordingly without worrying about bullshit that is happening beyond your own control.

In The Witcher 3, you can predict enemy attacks as well, but the whole time you are *praying* that Geralt doesn't do something completely stupid and that the janky hitboxes don't screw you over.

That's another thing The Witcher 3's combat lacks: consistency.

And say what you want about Skyrim's combat (only bringing up Skyrim because it's the game most brought up when someone criticizes TW3's combat in a desperate attempt of whataboutism):
It is at least consistent. 

The only thing you need to account for in Skyrim's combat is range. 

Every single attack can be reliably used unlike The Witcher 3's most basic attacks and the game gives you many options to circumvent the aspects you don't like.

The Witcher 3 doesn't have that luxury.

And, no, before anyone mentions it, Deathmarch doesn't fix the combat, contrary to belief in The Witcher 3's community.

Absolutely nothing that I mentioned above gets fixed.

It only makes the combat feel *worse* because all it does is turn enemies into health sponges and increases their damage against you.

Since the game has such atrocious hitboxes in the first place, that is a *major* no-no, and again, is probably the reason why Quen is so broken in the first place.


The end result is a pathetically simple, sluggish, and inconsistant combat system that really wasn't competently made on a technical or mechanical level.


It's actually the worst combat system from a AAA studio I have interacted with in over 17+ years.

I suppose the reason why the reason the combat is as bad as it is because CDPR has never bothered to hire combat designers or anything before Cyberpunk 2077.

Until Cyberpunk, they just winged it and didn't ever put any effort into making a good combat system. 

It has always been an afterthought to them.

https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-combat-designers

CDPR probably made an underpaid, overworked, and inexperienced employee design TW3's combat on the budget of a McDonald's happy meal, the poor guy.

That same guy is currently working on the new Fable's combat system.

I don't know if I should feel terrified or feel happy for him.

They better give him an actual budget this time, holy hell.


In other news, the same combat designer who worked on Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Horizon Forbidden West is working om The Witcher 4's combat system, so CDPR clearly learned from their experience with Cyberpunk 2077. 

They clearly disagree that TW3's combat system was good, *they themselves admitted they only did the bare minimum for TW3's combat* because they were entirely focused on everything else.

They are definitely looking to correct that with The Witcher 4.


And don't even get me started on the horseback riding, that's another topic entirely.


I *loathe* Roach with every *damn* *fiber* of my very being.



##TL;DR:

The Witcher 3 felt like *the* perfect game for me in nearly every single aspect.

But mechanically, it was *awful.* 

Fucking repugnant. Downright unacceptable.

Couldn't ever like the game because of it.

I really, really, *really* wanted to love this game, man.

It came in the wake of the Dragon Age games and Fallout New Vegas, it released the same year as Pillars of Eternity and Bloodborne, and it was predated by two decades of classic RPGs all the way back to Gothic II, Morrowind, Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, and even games like Vampire: The Masquerade and the original Deus Ex. 

The game's main selling points were its (admittedly very well produced) cutscenes and cutting-edge graphics, but as an RPG it really didn't hold a candle to its contemporaries *or* its predecessors---this looks to once again be the case with The Witcher 4, as it's being marketed primarily on its incredible graphics and mocapped animations, rather than its gameplay/systems.

919,gaming,mz5x0u6,t1_mz5q8sk,"BG3's companion system pissed me off so badly I couldn't finish the game. It's so frustrating cuz I LOVE every single companion, but for some reason they decided to only let you have 3 with you at a time despite 1. most of their content stems from their OWN storylines and don't have significant impact on the main story beyond their side stories and 2. most of their content DOESN'T negate each other unless you go the evil route. 

So it's essentially like playing God of War Ragnorak but instead of having each companion with you when their stories and character development calls for it, you instead had access to ALL of them at once. BUT you could *only* bring one with you at a time. But if you didn't bring them at the right time, you'd accidentally miss entire storylines because of it (despite the game not being clear on when you should bring them or not.) 

Like imagine bringing Freyja along with you and come across Angrboda without Atreus - meaning Freyja just sits there pretty much silent and adding nothing, meanwhile because you didn't bring Atreus, you cut yourself out of their entire relationship for the entire rest of the game. Like BRUHHHHHHHHHHHH that was my entire experience playing BG3 lmao. Pissed me off so bad. 

Like I get the idea is replaying the game but NO. There are NO choices in the game that changes your playthrough significantly enough to warrant another playthrough unless you just loved the game UNLESS you actually enjoy murdering and slaughtering innocents which is just not fun for me at all - nor most people. Like this was no Witcher 2 situation where if you didn't replay the game, you'd miss out on an entire 1/3rd of the game and it's perspective. Cause THAT'S how you make your choices feel significant enough that it makes you want to replay the whole game for it.

In BG3 every decision you make, and the order you make them in, can hugely impact the story you experience.

976,gaming,mz6alad,t1_mz5scoq,"The DS series, at least the first one, is pretty much straight ARPG. They're a hybrid of the RTS and (A)RPG genres, which is unsurprising as the main dev behind the original DS was coming off of working on Total Annihilation. Even the character behavior settings are in large part taken straight from TA.

For DS1, the story is mid at best, largely unimportant, and there aren't exactly any meaningful decisions to be made outside of what characters to hire and how to develop said characters. The world's effectively linear, though there are a fair number of secret areas throughout the game that reward careful exploration. Combat can largely be automated, which can make the early game small scale combat feel pretty dull, but higher difficulties will require a bit more micro.

That said, the game worked out of the box on my current Win10 machine despite installing it from its original cd release.

BG3 kinda just throws you into the game and lets you sink or swim. I can totally get how that is overwhelming for people. Persona 5 kinda holds your hand a bit more slowly introducing new systems so it feels less overwhelming.  That's not to say it doesn't have plenty of complexity to sink your teeth into, but it does ease you into it a bit more.

1012,gaming,mz76ame,t1_mz5sll2,"I think part of the difference that separates BG3 and TTRPGs, even chunkier ones, is how much there is to learn. You sit down to a table for a 5e game, have never played before, you need to learn the base mechanics, and what your character does. Thats it. If you absorb a little about what a wizard does by seeing them play, great, but you're not the wizard, you're the rogue, if you don't learn the wizard, that's fine.

In BG3 you need to learn the mechanics and all of the characters, how the work, what options are good, which are traps, etc. Sure, they trim it down, but when you have a cleric, warlock, barbarian, fighter, rogue, wizard, 2 druids, a ranger, and a paladin (plus whatever you picked for Tav if you opted to make your own character)...

1138,gaming,mz9jghf,t1_mz71hbq,"Huh, interesting. All the people I know who played it loved it, but also loved BG3 more. I've never played Dragon Age, but I've seen some gameplay and I don't think it's a similar enough combat style to be a good stepping in point for BG3. It has more in common with WoW's combat since it's not turn based, except it also has pausing. Imo, Divinity is a better introduction because of the similar turn based structure that isn't locked to a grid where the turn order is spelled out right at the start of combat. It also has multiple interactions with the abilities and spells to add nuance to fights, which is something BG3 does so well. I also think the action point and ability cooldown system can be more easily understood compared to the minor actions/major actions of BG3. Maybe I'm wrong with that. If someone already knows the DnD playstyle, then they'd pick it up quite quickly.

But in either case, both games (DAO and DOS2) are gonna be really cheap during the sale and Steam has 2 hour refunds. There's enough fights and story stuff within the first 2 hours of DOS2 that if you don't get hooked by then you probably won't like the game (even though the main meat and potatoes of that game starts with Act 2).",2025-06-22 18:51:38-08:00,HanzoNumbahOneFan,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz9jghf/,1

Added with the speed boost exoskeleton that lets you jump super far, and you're literally flying around the map and jumping off mountains.

I also never drove vehicles to new locations. The first couple treks around an area were all on foot, and only on subsequent visits to that area would I drive around using a truck or transporter bike as a kind of mobile hub for my materials/PCCs while I built up the roads and made a zipline network. Traversal did get much easier throughout the game, but it felt earned because I knew that I'd already navigated all that terrain before, and I could now watch it fly by from the sky or on a road.

Anyways, the games fall apart when the scaling is just a little off. Like, 1-3 hitting bosses or stunlocking them just because you unknowingly cleared a few too many dungeons. This can happen naturally in ER if you stumble into a meta build or play it like a completionist.

However, I think they absolutely could have had an easy mode in Sekiro. That’s my favorite game ever and I never recommend it because of how brutal it is.

1250,gaming,mz7csw7,t1_mz79085,"Yea I get that. Honestly the start of these games are really rough. Even if you’ve played these games it’s easy to die. The difference to me is I know all these games are kinda bs at the start so it’s pretty par for the course. Someone new will think all 100 hours is going to be crushingly difficult which isn’t the case at all. More like climactic difficulty after the start of the game. 

I know you don’t like looking stuff up, but Elden Ring is so insanely big that just watching some early game or starter build videos wont ruin the game. So knowing where to get a few health potion upgrades and quickly levels can smooth out the start of the game tremendously. Stuff like kill the sick dragon for early runes etc. you’ll see them. Actually, not using any strats can feel like a challenge run.

After you’re leveled up you can set the pace yourself. Elden Ring plays a lot like botw where you can kinda just wander around to places you think look cool while still progressing your character. When you have some levels behind you it’s very forgiving. 

Honestly if you want some non spoiler early game strat lmk. I can give you non-spoiler hints that won’t spoil anything but can help get you started.

To hear players bellyache about not getting to immerse themselves in the lore because the game is too hard is laughable. They evidently aren’t watching anybody play it or they would know that what you’re saying seems to be true. If you just play through these games without paying extra close  attention to the story and then replaying it a slightly different way to unlock a cutscene that half-explains a thing that happened in your first playthrough, they will make no fucking sense. Idk why people are trying to diminish your point, because the director of the game LITERALLY claims that the half-storytelling is totally intentional so as to emulate his experience being a young person reading books in english despite not really knowing english.

From my understanding, the whole plot of Dark Souls 1 is just that you are one of many random undead who was imprisoned JUST IN CASE you rise up to defeat the current ruler. You run around pretty much aimlessly until suddenly you’re supposed to decide which of two ancient serpents to trust about why the world is the way it is and how to “fix it,” and it ends up being the whole “One of us is lying and one of us is telling the truth” but the truth is super obscured, and the more you dig into the meat and potatoes, the more it seems like everybody is bad guys, but people will act like it’s obviously one way or another. 

I think for Elden Ring they brought on George R.R.

(((hey, this is gonna be a few replies cuz it's long haha))))

For the BTs, there's a few good ways to get through/past them. This may be long, but if it helps you continue the game, oh god please do read it all &lt;3.  I love the game and want everyone to love it like I do lol. 

I'm going to write a lot, but I""ll also share a vid someone amazing did with almost everything i'm writing. I'm adding more things they didn't touch on. But watching it will help you out too. Dude did a great job showing each step. I was very impressed! 

Now onward.
Most important if you didn't know this already: you can 'switch sides' on Sam so the camera (0ur view point) is over his left or right shoulder. Best view esp if you have tall cargo is to keep the camera over the left shoulder.  Now and then you'll have to switch sides to see/scout the area ahead and to the side but it doesn't happen often. You'll know when you'll need to. Another thing is that when Sam fully stops in bt areas, a few moments go by and he can see the BTs when they appear. The moment Sam moves, he can't see them any longer. So use that to your route planning advantage as well. That's his DOOMS gift; he can 'sense' them and we get to see faint glimpses of them only when they appear. HUGE help.

Through most of BT territory once the odradek slowly speeds up its 'clapping'in 4 levels. At the 3rd level, you're going to want to crouch and be ready to hold the breath. You can't hold it too long or Sam will soon be forced to take in a loud inhale - alerting BT's to him. You hear a heartbeat when he's holding his breath and an indicator of how much time is left shows on screen. So only hold the breath the second the odradek starts spinning fast and slowly back up. I'll touch more on this in a point below.

1: There are 4 levels of your odradek alerts:  

a) a very slow lazy clap. Maybe one per second. 

b) faster clapping, about 2 per second.

c) fast spin and BB starts to fuss and make crying noises

d) Fastest spin, it'd probably go airborne if it could. 

- your odradek will 'clap' slowly when BT's are in the immediate area but not dangerously close. As you get closer, the Odradek will 'clap' faster. That means to slow down to a slow walk and also squat down because they're very very close. When it starts spinning fast, you're almost on top of them and they're easily going to know you're there. Stop completely and survey what's around you. Stay chill. Keep holding the breath. If you get even closer, it'll spin the fastest and you're fixing to get grabbed at that point. If the bt sends the grabber (handprints running toward you on the ground) after you at any point during any of the spin speeds, DON""T panic. Keep holding the breath and keep walking away in the opposite direction. DON""T RUN, DONT STOP HOLDING YOUR BREATH, just keep squat walking the opposite direction. Most times you can escape it because it won't find you. If you do get grabbed and pulled to the ground, It's really no biggie. I'll explain the easiest method to get out of it without any issues. There's a bonus to this way also. If tar surrounds you, keep punching while walking forward. Practice this before BT territory: squat walking slow, holding the breath and then air punching.

1309,gaming,mz98dyf,t1_mz9871a,"2/3

  
2: Odradek always points at the closest BT. No matter if it's 'chirping' slowly, clapping faster (almost double time to the slow claps) or spinning fast or ultra fast, it'll always be pointing at the closest. If it's pointing toward (for example) the 2:00 position, head towards the 11:00 or noon position (noon, lol? Straight foward. Go straight forward. what's wrong with me?!). If it's started the 3rd/4th level of spinning fast, squat (Which you should already be squatting when the odradek starts its' 2nd level of clapping) and move away in the opposite direction. THe oderadek will slow its clapping or point to another close BT in the new direction - if so, walk away from that new bt as well. There's always ways past the BT's. 



Odradek is the guide for the blind, kind of. 



3: Scan with the odradek when it's in the slow clapping (first level) as much as you can. It'll help bt's appear even if Sam's walking. Whatever you do, don't scan at the 3rd and 4th level of spin. They'll be alerted and send a grabber BT to get you to drag you to the catcher. Also, don't yell. If you yell and it's spinning, they'll send a grabber.



4: in the vid Sam uses two amazing BT killing weapons. You won't get the gun until you get to the 2nd map which is after ch 3. The cuffs he used to cut the bt cords you wont get til around chapter 6 or 7 iirc. 



5: Oh no, you got grabbed by a grabber and got pulled far away to a giant BT. 

First off: relax. As soon as the grabber lets you go free, stand up and open your map. You'll see there's a black tar circle around your area. You'll notice you never went anywhere either: you're still in the exact same place you got grabbed at. So take a calming breath. You're safe. Find the closest area to your position where the black tar meets normal ground. Close the map and head there. You'll have to 'jump run"" to get there, but head there. Don't mind the big bt chasing you. You'll be fine. Once you cross that border of tar and Not-Tar, the tar behind you and the giant bt annnnnnnnd all the bts in the area will vanish and you won't have BT's there for a nice amount of time. A real nice long amount of time. Go fetch your cargo via the map, spray container repair spray on it and get it delivered. :)



6: You can do step 5 with a few of the giant huge bosses Higgs brings to your door also. The only one you can't do it with is the very last boss bt. Also, try to do a few boss bt fights. They're amazing once you get past the fear. You'll see buildings bobbing in the tar, sinking and coming back up over and over. You'll also now and then see whitish-grey looking people rising out of the tar and tossing things. Those are supposed to be the rest of us players, helping you out by tossing you grenades and so on. :) 



7: Ever see Sandalweed plants here and there as you run around? If your boots wear out, you can wear sandalweed on your feet for a little while to save the feet. It also muffles your steps to bt's as well. They won't notice you as easily. Playing on very easy and easy have a much wider 'bt can't sense you' area around it. Hard and Very Hard, bt will notice you when you're still kinda far away. So keep that in mind. (and change it to easy before doing fights with the soldier. You'll thank me later).



8: there are little charms you can get later throughout the game to put on your backpack carrier thing. One is a bell. It also makes it so it's harder for bT's to sense you. Equip it. You'll get that later in game also. 



one more tip: Snow is timefall also, and snow ages everything faster and harder than rain timefall. And cold is deadly. Don't nap in the elements.",2025-06-22 17:47:32-08:00,sarra1833,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz98dyf/,3

another tip: Get the truck. It's a godsend.

((((editing to add this: dont race a bike through any bt land. or a truck. they'll pull you out for sure. Park and walk through and clear the way first THEN ride/drive through.))))

one more: Read emails soon as you get them. Well, asap once you can open your cuffs or get to a safehouse/distro private quarters. Don't hoard. Read. ALL OF THEM LOL. Backstory is there, help is there, tidbits of info is there, more stuff to find is there. Same with computer entries. Read all of them. Absolutely please read all the things.

A BIG TIP: Get every place (even the hidden preppers. Yup, they exist) to 5 stars. Each star gained gives you a new weapon, or a new something, a better improved weapon or an improved something, a cosmetic doodad, or new goodies that are ammmmmaaaaaazing. Do side orders. Don't just follow the main story. you'll miss out on a ton by not doing this.

(What people think are MULES in the mountain area aren't MULES. They're encampments of Higgs' men. And they shoot lethal weapons. Don't ever shoot lethal weapons unless you know where the closest incinerator is and have time to cover up, drive and burn every body you kill. Every single one. Forget one and... game over.

OH: the old man. Keep freaking bringing him stuff. please. p=l=e=a=s=e. Every 50 orders or so come bring him stuff. Please. The regret if you don't is real.

and pay attention to what's being said, shown etc in the entire game. yeah the story is confusing af but as you go, it starts to make sense and comes together real well. Conversations, back stories, emails, computer journal entries, other entries. Read them all. Listen to it all. And the end isn't the end. Trust me. Keep waiting.

and please fall in love with Low Roar if you haven't already. They posthumously put Ryan's last work together in his final album ""A House in the Woods"". Released it on their yt channel in March. Gods if anything, even if you hate DS, I hope hope hope you fall in love with Low Roar.

I also hope you'll let me know if you do play DS again and let me know how you do. I can always give you help, too, please just send me a msg.

I spent well over 1700 usd on DS stuff; fan made, official made and made one of a kind just for me. I love the game and the world and the people. I'd be happy to chat with you about any aspect of the game.

Video Link. watch as much as you need to. Take notes. Copy him.

Like - you can carry an insane amount of food and items on your body somehow, but you HAVE to ALWAYS make sure you pick your long guns up from your horse cuz you can't just have them stored on your body. Like bruh bffr

BUT I was able to finish the game by the sheer will of taking it slow. I forgot who's video I watched that pretty much encouraged this sort of playstyle of treating it like a real world. I.e. taking in the scenery, just looking around and taking in the view, watching people and characters interact with one another, etc. Treating it like you're an ooold man just taaaking it slow. Relaxed. Almost like the way my therapist says to be mindful in the real world, I applied it to the game. And suddenly the game was genuinely SO much more wonderful and it ended up clicking. I wasn't rushing, I just kept walking around instead of running for the most part just to take in the views. 

Patience is a key part of making that game enjoyable. So if you ever do go back and try it out, just treat it like you're roleplaying a real cowboy. Living life in the wild in a way you can't now. Like - go take a walk in the park, enjoy the scenery, look at bugs, wildlife, etc. Then go play RDR2 and just do the exact same thing.

Too bad that there is only one fence in the whole damn game and it will take you 10+ minutes of driving your stolen wagon to get it to him! Did I mention that he is the one and only fence in the whole game, despite the game being set across several states in the United States? And you will get $20 for it. What’s that you say? You want to get more money for your stolen wagon? Sure, that’s possible, but the most valuable wagons are ALWAYS the furthest point away from the fence! I only did this twice during my whole play through. 

Want to get a Perfect Hide from each animal in the game? Cool! You will need to shoot each and every single animal with different weapons, ammo types and almost none of these special ammunition types are for sale, which means that you have to manually craft them, one at a time, and of course these resources are always difficult to find/acquire!

Which is ironic, you'd think it's the shootouts and gunplay (which imo suck) that you're supposed to expect the game to focus on, but instead the game is best played when you're just taking in the environment. Practicing mindfulness skills but in game as well. Going hunting, but ACTUALLY taking it slow i.e. crouching everywhere with no running. Stopping and taking in the environment, watching the way the leaves blow, looking at a squirrel, watching the waterfall. That's where the game is at it's best to me. 

Going back into it with that expectation actually got me to finish the game. The first time I played it I was never able to finish it. But the second, I was actually able to. 

Another option is to just HARD focus on story missions and nothing else. Just story stuff. That's honestly how I spent my time.

RDR2 is 100% about immersing the player in the world, and this is absolutely a part of it. 

Compare that to most other games — including a new game I currently *adore* and is going down as one of my all time favorites, Clair Obscur Expedition 33 — where the over the top action hero 3x speed running animations completely throw me for a loop. Yes, it *feels* better purely from a video game gameplay standpoint, but from an immersive standpoint, it feels *off*, almost comically so.

This process restores the weapon's durability and can also add a bonus effect.

Find a Rock Octorok: These creatures are commonly found in areas like the Eldin region. 
Drop the weapon: Unequip the weapon you want to repair and drop it near the Octorok. 


Back away: The Octorok will start sucking in air. Move away to avoid damage when it spits the weapon back out. 


Observe the sparkle: You'll see a sparkling animation as the Octorok repairs the weapon. 
Collect your repaired weapon: The Octorok will spit the weapon back at you. Pick it up to find it fully repaired and with a random modifier. 


One weapon per Octorok: Each Octorok can only repair one weapon at a time. You'll need to defeat it and wait for a Blood Moon to respawn it for another repair.",2025-06-22 09:49:42-08:00,denkmusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6snk0/,0

1453,gaming,mz5x9ht,t1_mz5oek7,"It took me multiple attempts to properly get into Sekiro, and that's as a die hard Soulsborne/Elden Ring fan. Similiarly, I've just always sucked at parrying and wasn't enjoying being forced into it. Being a seasonsed Soulsborne player is probably detrimental to getting good at Sekiro if anything.

For whatever it's worth, a few YouTube videos helped make it click when I realized that missing the perfect parry timing by blocking too early but still blocking (and sometimes holding the button a fraction of a second longer than a quick tap) was still vastly superior to getting blasted in the face by blocking too late. It was much easier to figure out the rhythms when that much sinks in, and you start to learn that the parry window is surprisingly generous if you're suitably proactive. That, and realizing that the Soulsborne instincts of ""dodge/roll behind enemy"" has the opposite reality in Sekiro. Staying in the enemies' faces and being aggressive as fuck is much, much safer. 

Still had a few insanely tough stretches, and I spent a few hours convinced I was physically incapable of beating the final boss.

1496,gaming,mz6egni,t1_mz6bic6,"I dont usually double back in my story games but compelling reasons for small detachment of increased enemies in a cleverly done way are possible but seeing the field just constantly erase my progress is annoying. 

Worse when suddenly it'd a basic area full of enemies far beyond the level that makes sense for that area. An example is in Jedi Survivor the basic area which had a couple storm trooper patrols and some monsters was now full of elite troops late game and scout walker techs and other things just in the open world area. This mind you after having actually blown up the storm trooper garrison base many hours prior which was blessed with two walkers at most to protect it. No story or plot reasons for the reinforcement and it was a barely occupied area in the first place. In another area that made more sense for troops the level of enemies still got unrealisticallly increased excessively where it didn't make sense. After making some progress and then saving and resting having everything I cleared out returned is really insulting. 

Open world syndrome is a major issue that decreases depth in favor of quantity over quality for rpgs and other games but the time commitment and waste elements just keep getting worse.

  
A scout transport coming to see why the base wasn't making communication anymore and maybe even an attempt to rebuild it over months could have been argued but just instant enemies is not competing. I'm just tired of the same shit over and over and over. 

I did prefer semi linear games like dragon age origins and how enemies didnt respawn. But some back trackign occurrs and a tiny increae in enemies from swarms or such makes a little sense sure.

Would’ve prevented a lot of the criticisms of its bosses—Sekiro’s boss moves are clearly telegraphed which leads to its bosses being fun both pre and post mastery by making the learning process more flowy. Elden Ring goes out of its way to obfuscate the correct ‘answers’ which backloads the fun to a large extent. I don’t think Sekiro’s bosses would’ve been as well received without the indicators.

When/if you get to the main area (Firelink Shrine), there's about 3 different routes you can take. Avoid the graveyard with the skeletons or the area with ghosts just over a bridge. You'll quit again if you do. Instead follow the stairs round the side of the the cliff where there's some normal undead guys and a route into an aqueduct. That's the route you should take.

Generally there's around 3 major turning points that people will give up on:

* First boss
* Capra Demon Boss (Maybe watch a few videos on YouTube if you get stuck)
* Another boss called Ornstein &amp; Smough

But if you have the Remastered version you can always hop on a Discord and ask people to join your world as a summon to help and they will!

It made me realize that most of Sekiro’s bosses have really straightforward natural attacks. There’s a whole lot of attacks quickly, but they don’t do that weird hang in mid air for half a second longer than you think for every attack.

It also helps you can cancel out of an attack to guard/parry so you’re always attacking or parrying. I always get greedy in ER because I’m not used to waiting for an attack window.

There's a ton of lore there, but you can essentially engage with it as much or little as you want via optional conversations, item descriptions, etc. And/or watch heavily researched and produced YouTube videos that can summarize everything. 

Despite the intricate worlds, these games are much more focused on immersing you in them while feeling like an insignificant and uninformed participant for a while, rather than straight up telling you a traditional three-act story.

The boss is fine, he's cool, but putting him in a spot where players are just learning the mechanics means that what he teaches the players is exactly the message they need to NOT GET until they understand how parrying works. The game is about parrying. The first areas are supposed to teach you to parry, and show you how useful and rewarding it can be, and how just dodging and keeping your distance isn't going to work out very well over the course of the game. So, of course, what's the central mechanic for the first serious miniboss most players will encounter, the capstone of this teaching moment, the thing that should sink the message into their heads with an obvious demonstration?

First of all, cooking is so unnecessary. There's like two recipes you'll ever need.

Second, there's no weapon in the game that you can't get multiple copies of. Chests and items in the overworld respawn every blood moon. Place a couple of stamps on locations of your favorites, and next time the world resets you can replenish your stock. If you desperately need to, there are even ways to force and cheese a manual blood moon activation.

1755,gaming,mz7dxau,t1_mz6kt7f,"Haven't played TotK as yet but the dungeons definitely had variety in terms of the puzzles in BotW. Sure, same aesthetic across the board for the most part but I don't know if a homogeneous aesthetic for the dungeons is a fair critique when the over world had so much variety in climate, especially when you're saying lack of variety in general.

And imo, it's not that fair to talk no about variety across multiple aspects when having so many aspects is of itself providing variety. I'll give you weapons and to an extent enemies because together they provide probably half of the interactivity in the game. But then it also comes down to whether is the game for you. If weapons and enemies (and there *were* quite a bit of enemies) broke the game for you, then maybe you aren't the intended audience. Exploration, dungeons, and side missions (whether from npcs or discovering secrets) are all integral aspects of BotW, and because there is so much of that, weapons and enemies being comparatively not that fleshed out in theory should be a minor flaw. I think at most, I'd say having two tough mobs (the Taluses and Hinoxes are bosses) in addition to the lynels would had a massive effect. Now keep in mind, if you never explored because the organic/curiosity-based exploration is just not for you (and that was how the game failed for quite a bit of people), you're never going to fight a lot of the enemies in the game. I only say this because you said there's a good *chance* you'll be repeating puzzles.

I played on 3 different teams in that span and there were generally some people on those teams that just werent very good/coordinated/skilled or were too big, too small, etc.. Sure, there were heated moments about missing a pass or a shot or some kind of screwup that allowed a goal or whatever but at no point did we collectively shit on/bully those people in a psychotic, ass backwards attempt to ""make them better"" or force them to quit.

My coaches would sometimes bark at people about this or that, but they didnt sit and harp on them \*the whole game\* about it, and continue on \*after\* the game, and the next practice(s) \*after it happened and bring it up multiple games \*after\* the fact.",2025-06-22 09:14:57-08:00,_Saint_Ajora_,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6lgo9/,3

1861,gaming,mz6h008,t1_mz5ponj,"I actually have an incredible story about my time playing Ark, which is basically an unpaid job and I don't recommend it. At the time I was unemployed and awaiting a visa to be issued, so I had like 4 months to sit around.

I played the game, made some friends, we started a base together. Server was pvp but all our neighbors were friendly, with an alpha tribe basically in charge of the server. They weren't bullies or anything, occasionally flexed but would otherwise leave everyone alone as long as we didn't try anything.

I was told stories by the people who had been on the server for years at that point about the previous alpha tribe, ""The Night People"". Big bloody war, but they were all wiped and basically exiled from the server a long time before. Such is the game.

One day, I log on to do my chores and it's absolute pandemonium. Our walls are broken, half our dinos are dead, and it's all out war on the server. Our neighbors are gone, and there is a massive steel tower that suddenly appeared.

The Night People returned, but they were never actually gone, as they had spent more than a year undercover. They were our neighbors as well as various other tribes, who had created new steam accounts and repurchased the game to not be recognized in chat. Overnight, they pooled resources into a massive fortified base. They somehow employed   dozens of Chinese players to swarm the server and gave them all weapons and mounts to cause chaos.

I fought in that final battle alongside our alpha tribe, but it was no use. I'll always remember when they unlocked their chests and told us to dump everything. Better gone than in the hands of the enemy.

It was more loot than I had ever seen. Amounts that would have taken weeks if not months to farm. Needless to say, we were wiped, and I stopped playing.

I don't recommend playing Ark but I'll never forget the sheer dedication some people put into it. I'm astonished to this day.",2025-06-22 08:53:05-08:00,Rickz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6h008/,12

Nothing made sense, nothing was explained, nothing worked in any sort of intuitive manner, everything seemed designed for maximum inefficiency and annoyance.

I hate it when games hold my hand and refuse to let go, especially with survival games.  But there's a balance to it where you give the player breadcrumbs to figure it out for themselves.

1894,gaming,mz7pc0z,t1_mz65wwz,"Are you perhaps american? Cuz I swear I always read these reports of people being constantly toxic but I rarely get those in EUW.  
It’s not like it never happens here, sometimes it does as well of course but like, maybe once in ten games.  
And then I just either full mute them or just mute their chat so I still see their pings. Most of the times I don’t even have to because the game immediately system-mutes and warns the toxic player anyway.
 
And I did go through all low ranks from iron to plat, the lower ones are the ones with the most toxicity.  
  
I once had this theory that the NA toxicity problem has something to do with americans being:  
Always overly nice to everyone irl, always with that fake-smile in public, doing random small talk with strangers in the parc, at the checkout and all those places all the time, despite not actually caring and just doing it because of the social norm (supposedly, I never was in the US so I base it all on cliches and online-persecution).  
And then let the frustration out on strangers on the internet where they remain anonym.  
  
League additionally being an extremely complex game that requires hard strategic thinking on both micro and macro basis, memorizing over 150 champions with 4 unique abilities + passive each and all the matchups and objectives, being mechanical hard, being so punishing that 1 single misstake from ONE player can lose the 30-60min long game for the entire team doesn’t help either.

1912,gaming,mz8pmct,t1_mz5y891,"They're still using a bunch of placeholders from the original shootergame.exe that ARK was made with back in 2013-2015. Even their 'from the ground up remake' was just an intern using the UE5 code converter to port the exact same game into a slightly newer engine. 


Dinosaur behaviour is that of bumper cars - all they do is walk unnaturally in one direction until they hit an obstacle, where they'll likely stay until you leave render distance. 


Dino fights are just the same attack animation over and over, until one dino's HP is depleted and the dead body ragdolls into nightmare fuel. 


Human animations haven't been updated since then either. It has the most unnatural looking walking/running/swimming/resource collection animations, where like the Sims they reuse the same petting action for nearly everything (except petting your creatures, they've been unable to program that despite having the exact same system in place for imprinting babies since launch). 


The game feels decades old because parts of it are, but Wildcard don't care. They'd rather pay an ungodly amount to an anime studio to make new cutscenes instead of actually putting that money back into the game and working on their own. 


But they've got a special new DLC just for you to keep you distracted from their mess, with another planned distraction in a few months... 


They're sitting at their studios just wringing money out of the game, deliberately putting off working on the parts  people have already paid for in place of more wonky DLC for even more money (their latest DLC is the same price as the base game was in AUS, as was Astraeos, their last singular DLC map). ",2025-06-22 15:58:12-08:00,ARK_survivor_69,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8pmct/,4

There are explorer notes written by one of the previous ARK survivors, some of which are very informative - but they spread them across the map randomly, instead of concentrating the important ones in the beginner's area. 


In game, you wouldn't know how to tame a triceratops until you've either tamed a megalodon or maybe an icthyosaurus, gotten SCUBA gear, and swam down to the very bottom of the ocean (where the mosasaurs, giant squid, dunkleostus etc all live) and found the hidden cave with the Triceratops dossier.

Insulting others while playing in silver/gold Elo after ALL this time wasted in the game, but not actually improving… 

And then they ALWAYS respond with „of course I cant climb when I get such teammates“ or go down the „Elo Hell / Losers Queue“ conspiracy theory, which is soo stupid, one of the dumbest rabbit holes you can go down.
  
Yes sometimes you get bad teammates but just ss much as you as an ADC get a shit support, the enemy ADC also can get a bad one.  
Many aspects of the game are random, but you are the only constant variable in your matches. But while the enemy team has 5 potential monkeys trolling and running it down, your team has only 4 of them (assuming you yourself are not trolling and play as good as you keep saying of course), then you STATISTICALLY WILL climb and rank up.  
  
Everyone consistently performing above average after playing a decent amount of games will inevitably get a higher rank. If you play like 30-100 matches a season and have a negative % winrate, it’s not your teammates, it’s YOU.

2003,gaming,mz7lgmf,t1_mz5pztm,"The toxicity part is true to some extent, especially as a jungler I just mute the toxic person at the very first mean comment or just ‚/mute all‘ when whole team start arguing in chat. But I feel like the amount of toxicity depends on the region you play in. Most matches are chill in EUW tbh. Korean low elo is known to be the most toxic one of all. But in the western regions whenever I see people complaining about toxicity, its mostly americans. So I assume NA is one of the more toxic regions to play in.
  
It’s so bizzare to me why people get toxic in the flrst place, I also get mad at my teammates sometimes as well but I just think it in my head or say it out loud in my room - NEVER let those comments out in chat. It’s statistically lowering the chances of you winning snd therefore loses you LP because newsflash: Poeple wont just magically start playing better after getting called an idiot. The opposite will happen, either they lose mental and subconscious will start playing worse and not try as hard, or talk back to you spending more time chatting rather then properly playing, maybe even intentionally ruin the game to show you.  
  
As for the rest you said: I disagree. You dont need to watch any videos or learn mathematically correct itemization, wave management, advanced strategies and insane mechanics on complex champions. You will be places iron/bronze/silver ofc, but with time you’ll learn most of that anyway by experience the same way children can learn different languages simply by watching a cartoon in said language. They will learn slower then the kids who watch cartoons at home and additionally get a teached by other people in school and learn the letters of that language etc, but they still will learn enough to confidently speak it.  

Same thing with League, if you want to climb you will have to use sites like lolalytics.com for statistics, winrates, items etc. Learning wave management, objective, strats and different champion matchups and team comps through YouTube will make you above average at the game. But even most of gold elo players still don’t know what „freezing a wave“ or „vertical jungling“ means and they still got out of silver without watching videos and stuff",2025-06-22 12:17:42-08:00,Unkn0wn-G0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz7lgmf/,1

Looking at games I liked that had open worlds or something similar would probably be Deus Ex HR and Mankind Divided but these are really more hubs except MD has a much larger one. I didn't like each of these hubs tho myself. 

Divinity Original Sin 2, Baldurs Gate 3 and Fallout 3 /w Broken Steel or New Vegas all have strong open world or hub based open worlds. DOS2 is a bit weaker than BG3 in the npc category but they're both good contenders. And I cant ignore Throne breaker but that's a different type of rpg.

I usually try to avoid open worlds even if its very hard to do. 

I think Witcher 3 does a better open world job than CP as well since its a bit more immersive.

Wilhelm becoming more robotic as you unlocked more skills was a great touch as well.

But then they never actually gave you good fights to use those abilities in! Other Borderlands games had a lot of fights with tons of different enemies at once, which let you really use all of your tools in a big fight. In the pre-sequel there's, I think, only one fight with more than a dozen enemies in it. Most fights are much smaller and spread out.

2231,gaming,mz6aor6,t1_mz5s69l,"While all those games fall under the general umbrella of tactical combat games, the gameplay in Midnight Suns is so different from the X-COM games that I don't even know if it's a valid comparison.  I wasn't sure about the gameplay myself when I first heard what it'd be like, but I ended up loving it.  (The actual missions, that is, not all the social crap and other stuff you do at the mansion between missions.)

If you want another game that's like X-COM, I recommend giving Mutant Year Zero: Road To Eden a try if you haven't already.  I'd say the gameplay isn't quite as good as X-COM because it doesn't have all the tactical decisions you have to make between missions that affect your success, but it makes up for it with a much stronger story and real characters rather than randomly-generated units.",2025-06-22 08:20:28-08:00,Zolo49,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6aor6/,2

I could see how it might turn some people off though - either the horror/thalassophobia elements or some of the enforced gameplay loops make it hard to really focus on one specific thing without a minimum investment in the other areas. The combat isn't the greatest, and there's minimal fast travel. Also no map, but I guess that forces you to utilize beacons and pay close attention to compass directions and distances.

I'm curious if you know what caused the bouncing off. I tried Valheim and didn't quite bounce off of it, but ended up sputtering out before the mistlands.

Survival aspects are tame enough to be not overwhelming (except for **OXYGEN**), combat is totally optional and there is no artificial day/night cycle that puts you on a timer while you are focused on doing your shit.

2334,gaming,mz7xlq4,t1_mz6wh0d,It's realistically either going to be a resource grind like early Terraria or a boss gauntlet like late Terraria. People complain about either.,2025-06-22 13:20:06-08:00,Umbra_RS,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz7xlq4/,2
2335,gaming,mz8kkkn,t1_mz7xlq4,"the problem with that is that the resource grind is no different than what it was in the early game, and the amounts requires are generally huge amounts or very slow to get.

The boss gauntlet is more of a matter that there's nothing inbetween.

The reason the early game works is because you're just getting your bearings, and every resource is working towards something, and each discovery is beneficial, even if it's just for building, and you're working for each boss, and using the drops of each boss + new resources to progress to the next stage of the game.

Let's take terraria as an example for this:

Early game - looking for resources to build housing (overworld resources day), getting basic weapons, armor, accessories and max hp (underground). With fun finds inbetween. And to increase max mp (overworld night).

It's all to fight the first boss, which then allows you to easier traverse other biomes and upgrade your gear for the next boss - skeletron (i know i skipped one), which let's you enter the dungeon, which is a whole new experience at the time, moreso than just different biomes.

After killing WoF though, you're now revisiting the same areas as before, but with less slow tactical strategy, and more with faster arcadey flailing. Now you're just looking for key upgrade items, but there's no accessory to worry about, no hp to increase, no mp to gain, and all you need now is to endlessly grind a large amount of resources for consumables and kill like 7 bosses in a row which designs do not differ from the previous ones enough.

The same problem I had with V rising. After the initial exploration of camps, towns and resource gathering. The bosses became all samey, and the resource gathering became just ""do the same thing you did before but more often and in more annoying ways"".

Valheim actually had the opposite problem. The early game is abysmally slow because of just how much shit you need to gather, and it doesn't get faster, the amount of farming and gathering goes quite insane, and the game is super slow as is. However, once you enter the mislands, the upgrades actually feel tangable and the exploration feels more unique. It just sucks it takes so long to get into magic, and the thing that holds the game back the most are corpse runs and incredibly obnoxious area traversal. But raiding that ashlands castle with a group was certainly a fun experience, it just took forever to get there.",2025-06-22 15:28:47-08:00,Trying_to_survive20k,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8kkkn/,1

Sunbeam timer is seemingly random and you can get it extremely early sometimes, in my first run I had it very early on so I already had effectively the next set of things to do before I even had finished some of the earlier stuff, although I know it can come late and you get a few hours of not being sure what to do.

Later on it does get tough as you basically have to go find the islands by yourself and explore them, and unless you notice that the islands are always hidden where the clouds are its hard to find them. After that you basically just have to go by the PDAs to roughly find where the next things are, and you better not have missed any of them else you can get lost fast.

And materials being the only requirement for being able to make them (not recipes).

Take a bullet to the face from someone you didn't see; were they using x-ray and aimbot, are they highly skilled, did they have a great ambush spot, or did they just get lucky?  You'll never know!  Shoddy netcode exacerbates this.  Player can rush around a corner and shoot someone before their game even registers it.  

The lack of any sort of ranked matchmaking is just a huge kick in the teeth for newer players (or, shit, even experienced ones who just don't have the time to grind) when useful ammunition and body armour is level gated.

And the game is just buggy as hell in general and performs like dogshit.

2501,gaming,mzad9mh,t1_mz8x676,"I think the primary issue is the progression through the game, like the physical space. You have the forest which should be considered the starter zone, and you functionally stay there, only dipping to the desert for gasoline. Then you move to the wasteland (or whatever it’s called) once you can kill wildlife because that’s far and away the quickest way to progress. Once you know the linear progression doesn’t really utilize the whole map, it kind of kills the drive to play and explore. If they set up more mechanic gating, like make it to where the desert is the FIRST place to find materials for gasoline, but also the safest. Then in the desert you need to farm things to survive cold weather, etc. make the progression actually move you through the map. 

I love the game, I played the hell out of it, but the only replay-ability we got out of it was massively increasing the difficulty. There needs to be serious thought put into how one thing unlocks the next, unlocks the next, etc


I can tolerate how dumb the magazine system is as a progression mechanic, and a few of the other things like skill trees being imbalanced, I just need to overall progression to be better thought out. Driving from trader to trader being one of the best ways to progress is crazy. The fastest leveling being from digging is also ridiculous. There are just fundamental bad design decisions that I feel like should have been fixed years ago, but they keep making the game worse in a lot of regards.

This is sort of the worst of all possible worlds though. Or at least it was what put me off of the game.

Things being ""within a few minutes of the starting point"" made the game designers think that forcing you to start over over and over was now a viable option.

But just as I would hate having to run for 3 minutes to do a hard boss fight over and over, I **hated** having to take 3 minutes to get back into position to retry some uber-time sensitive part of the mandatory progression.

If you're going to make the game hard to get past without dying, you need to make it quick to restart, as games like Celeste do.

If you're going to make it take awhile to get back to a place to try again (and yes, even 3 minutes is too long), then you need to let the player actually take a crack at the problem rather than forcing them to restart if they can't solve your fancy dexterity trap or mind game in just 30 seconds.",2025-06-23 08:29:18-08:00,mpyne,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mzcr5r2/,4

2680,gaming,mz8wlb3,t1_mz88up0,"I've looked at Eve a couple times. Once at university after getting off WOW and playing a bit of a free two week trial. Didn't have the time for it so never played it more than for just a few days.

Then again more recently when it went free to play and I just played for a day to see if it was worth it.

It's a fascinating social experiment but I'm not sure I'd even call it a game. The movement and combat are so limited that it's done explaining it to you within five minutes. Click on a location to travel to it. Click on an enemy to orbit it and fire until one of you dies. There is so little to the basic gameplay loop.

 However since the first time I looked at it they'd brought in quite an interesting tutorial with some story missions and PVE content and you could get out of your ship and see your avatar in the space station. The door was locked though and you couldn't leave your quarters or interact with anyone. The dialogue said something about a gas leak in the station or something if I recall.

I posted about it on the forum, said how I liked how I could leave the ship and asked how I could get into the station and interact with other players and immediately got shouted down by a dozen users. Apparently the developers had been looking to let users walk around the stations and have content in them but the community was so extremely hostile to the idea of it that they had to abandon it so it never got beyond the first phase. They play an MMO and yet have no interest in any sort of social content.

I had a look at some bios of users that were at the top of the bounty hunter and economic charts. A disturbingly large number of them actively warned users away from playing the game and bemoaned how much of their life they had wasted on it. Some said it wasn't even a game and had just become a second job.

There is effectively no point in playing the game now because unless you're going to drop a lot of money paying to fast level stuff it is physically not possible to ever catch up with the players who've been on there for years. It's why the playerbase numbers are so low and have been for years.

Training skills is just about clicking on the skill and waiting for the timer to countdown. The time to train the next rank of a skill ultimately becomes months and then years. Some players only log in when it is time to train the next skill. So that player you see with a massive capital ship engaging in epic battles is just never going to be you unless you pay money or wait for years.

I always liked the music and aesthetic in Eve so I thought before I abandoned it entirely I'd just take a leisurely cruise across the galaxy and see what happened if I entered a system controlled by a guild. So I pointed at the furthest system I could reach and set the escape pod to travel there.

As I entered the system two large ships were waiting at the ring and immediately targeted and killed me. They had player names on them and I really hope those players just had some script running that auto fired at whatever entered the ring. I hope they didn't spend all day sat at the computer guarding it manually.",2025-06-22 16:39:07-08:00,DeleteriousDiploid,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8wlb3/,5
2681,gaming,mzbaht2,t1_mz8wlb3,"I know that’s what you probably assumed combat is like and it is for quite a lot of the large battles, where you anchor (basically your ship follows someone, usually the fleet commander), and you press the shoot guns button at whatever target he shouts at, but the game mechanics behind it are a bit more complex than just orbit a target and press your guns on it.

There’s a lot of mechanics, half the battle is decided by what ships you bring and how they’re fit, close range brawler type ships will struggle against long range kite fits unless they find a way to reach their targets. Application of damage also matters, some weapon types are really good at killing small shit, others are really good at killing huge shit, if you try and use big guns on small target you’ll struggle to actually hit them etc etc.

To the untrained eye yes, it does look very simple, and tbh that is one of the problems that the game has, it doesn’t actually explain or show how deep the game mechanics can be. Most of the really really good pvpers, who usually will fly in small fleets of like 5-10 people are manually piloting their ships, and it gets a bit messy because it is a 3D plane. You can spend hours and hours theorising fits for ships and quite a large portion of people do exactly that.

The reason why there is a very small but committed population for eve is simply because there isn’t quite anything like it. Some people do take the game a bit too seriously, mainly the really large corps in nullsec, but the other side of the community is just 40 year old dads that want to drink some beers after work and shoot some ships.",2025-06-23 03:48:09-08:00,CRIKEYM8CROCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mzbaht2/,1
2682,gaming,mz88y6f,t1_mz6zoh9,"Othe good stuff to do as someone who can regularly get through as long as I want on most characters:

Build bee boxes early, around day 8-12. This will give you a lot of honey pre-winter. 

Make a crockpot, around 9 drying racks (more is better) and a fridge (2 is better) as an absolute priority once you have set down your base. Use this to dry out monster meat that you will just get through playing by killing spiders / tree monsters / hounds. One monster jerky + one small meat + one honey makes a 40 food dish so now you can subsist of 2 rabbits per day.

Once you have the above set up, start hunting down bigger meat sources - beefalo, koelefants (from suspicious dirt piles) and you’ll get some from each giant too as you play. One monster meat + one regular meat (or jerky variants) + 2 honey is one of the best food + health meals in the game and by now honey and monster meat will basically never run out. 

Going into winter you should have: a base with a fire pit, alchemy engine, crockpot, 2 fridges, 9+ frying racks, 4 bee boxes, and a small bunch of twigs and grass stems that you have relocated nearby (20-40 of each). 

On your character you should try to have a beefalo hat, a thermal stone and gold tools by this point too. I would also aim to build ~4 blow darts before winter and more throughout and hunt down mcTusk. Just kill the big one, he drops one blow dart, the walrus tusk (for the walking cane which is a massive speed boost)  and the Tam’o’Shanter hat (really good for sanity). 


This + learning to kite the enemies will get you through to summer very easily in the base game and if you are playing reign of giants, it will get you through winter.

A lot of modern games also offer alternative controls that entirely remove any motions. They're not usually used a lot because doing motions is just fun and most of the people that hate motions quit regardless because they never properly learn the games anyway.

All that being said, they are just games and they're meant to be fun and there is no reason to play them if they're not fun to someone.

Being behind other people is expected, because being ""perfect for beginners"" also means that experienced players with foundational skills can apply their foundational skills IMMEDIATELY and jump straight into advanced applications.

If you have 50 hours learning Xrd, your friend Alice has 40 hours learning Xrd, but you spent your 50 hours building up foundational skills and she spent her 40 hours learning one Chipp 50/50 gimmick and how to loop it into itself, that's going to be a struggle. If your friend Bob has 5 hours in Xrd but 2500 hours in AC+R, his knowledge of how fighting games work is going to transfer over way faster than you building them from scratch. 

With regard to your experience in Xrd: by and large, tutorials in fighting games tell you what tools *exist* in the first place rather than how to use them. They'll tell you that blocking exists, that instant blocking exists, that Faultless Defense exists, and that you can block high or low, but they won't tell you exactly how your opponent is building a pressure sequence and what you need to do to escape. They also won't tell you how to build pressure sequences that your opponents will have to *work* to escape. That's stuff that, in general, *you* get to work on as a player, usually with the assistance of other players and/or the resources they've made (dustloop wiki for Arcsys games like GG, supercombo for SF, wavu for tekken, mizumi for niche anime fighters, YouTube videos for all of the above).",2025-06-22 16:28:06-08:00,Furyful_Fawful,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8upad/,5

In sf6, a plan might be throw fireballs till they jump over one, then uppercut. Or it could be even easier, sweep kick until they jump, then try to throw them whenever they land.

Your plan is going to fail until you end up getting matchmade with people your rank (first 5-10 games will feel like button mash and still lose), then it'll work about 30-80% of the time. And if you see something beating your plan over and over, you'll start wanting to check out counters, and what a ""right"" response might be. 

Now your plan evolves. At some point you'll get comboed for half your health bar and you'll realize you can weave combos into your plan too (start small like crouching kicks into fireballs). And then just keep evolving to respond to what you face.

2981,gaming,mz7t2sr,t1_mz5tvmw,"Couple things to say on this

1.) A lot of this comes down to practice. I used to HATE Street Fighter and Tekken, but my friends were very patient with me and helped ease me into it. Playing fighting games is like learning a musical instrument. It requires a time commitment to learn the systems and combos. Once I found a character I gelled with and got a better handle on the systems, I improved a lot and started having a lot more fun. 

2.) Having a MENTOR / RIVAL is incredibly important to your growth. My best friend will sit down with me and play 30 rounds of Street Fighter 6 in a row. I’ll maybe win 1. But the entire time I’m learning what I need to improve on from someone who has many years more experience than me. 

3.) You will lose more than you win, especially when starting out. That’s normal. You cannot expect to be good at something the first time you try it. I’ve been playing for years now and I still feel like a beginner. From what I understand, that feeling never really goes away. 

4.) DON’T play online until you have a strong grasp of the mechanics. You will get bodied and it will not be fun.

Give something like soul calibre a try (as it has a decent enough storyline to be entertaining while clearing stages, and each story is different)

Once you’ve cleared the game a few times give it a go with one of the hard characters (like the dude who switches weapons every fight) this way you’ll get a feeling for every character and their matchups and weaknesses.

How have FPS modernized over the years? You still haven't explained what ""modernized"" means to you other than me assuming you mean ""it's different"". I'm going to do my best to try and respond to your different points and ask more clarifying questions, excuse me if I miss any or misunderstand what you are saying.

\-I am not sure why being 2D means it's not modern. There are many popular 2D games to this day, just look at the success of games like Hollow Knight or Animal Well.   
  
\-Yes in a fighting game you (usually but not always) look at your opponent, it is an intrinsic part of fighting someone. Generally it's not a good idea to look away from your opponent in Boxing for example, it's just a mechanical requirement. You wouldn't be saying ""but why am I steering in a racing game?"".   
  
\-I am also not entirely sure what you mean by ""awkward movement"". I can understand not liking the limitations of something like street fighter, where the movement is made in a way to make the game more calculated and controlled, but there are still fluid movement games so I certainly wouldn't apply that to whole genre. Smash bros is probably the most well known example, with Melee being quite quick/fluid depending on the character. If you don't consider platform fighters to be fighting games, while I disagree then I would use the example of any anime airdahser game, think Dragonball or maybe Blazblue. (Some people also include KoF so I'll add that here but don't 100% agree with them.)

\-No fighting game you should be ""just throwing out hitboxes"" because that's how you get yourself counter-hit. If you are just throwing something out constantly, a good opponent will just block/avoid the hit, then attack you while you are in your recovery frames where you can't input any commands. I can see how it might seem like that's what's happening in top level play but it is a game of thinking and pressure. 

  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like to me you are mixing up what fighting games are with spectacle hack-n-slash games. You think a fighting game is a game about bashing on each other instead of a game about thinking and reacting. While I can see early fighting games being more about brawling, especially the very early arcade ones, they have overall moved to more of a thinking game style. You are playing a real-time, turn-based game. (Your turn is when you capitalize on an opening, it's over when your combo ends. Then is reset to neutral.) I can understand the appeal of wanting all the damage to be done in a single hit instead of through a string of combo'd moves based on hitconfirms and mind games. But the combo system a lot of fight games rely on allow for more counter-play. Instead of losing because you messed up once or twice, you gain chances back based on how good your opponent is at the game. Even games like Tekken, top level players can do crazy long combos but still drop them. All that said, there are still very different fighting games out there, maybe something like, ""Your Only Move is HUSTLE"" or ""Lethal League"" would be something you would consider a ""modern"" fighting game.",2025-06-23 09:28:20-08:00,Grimdire,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mzd40zf/,2

3025,gaming,mz9tet4,t1_mz9phf1,"ms is already 1/1000 of a second, no game is asking for 0.1 ms reaction time to my knowledge. Sorry, I had to clear that up before continuing.

There's a (pseudo) counter argument to this. I'll use Street fighter 4 as an example. 

SF4 has combos that were 1 or 2 frames gap. So you had 1/60th of a second to input the next button to continue the combo. I didn't feel like I ever had a 1/60th second reaction time. But I could hit two buttons with a frame gap (essentially hit the buttons right after each other). Modern fighting games also have buffers, so if I were to hit the buttons a bit more/less than 1 frame apart, it'd still count. There's also the delay from controller to device, and device to screen, and network delays (pc to server and back) in multiplayer, so there's definitely leniency on inputs.

So at least for combos, I'd argue it's really down to practice the pacing for a lot of modern fighting games.

The reaction time does play a huge role in knowing when to (not) hit a button based on what your opponent is doing, but usually doesn't apply to executing combos (except if you mess up and need to stop the combo instead of being on autopilot).

Haven't played onechanbara before, so can't comment on that. Was it a 2D anime fighting game?

Builders and Builders 2 I loved, but I grew up with Dragon Warrior/Quest. In the first game rebuilding the towns I knew was awesome and I liked the challenge of starting each chapter with fewer resources and testing my building chops. I enjoyed rolling into Tantagel in my underwear and fighting a green dragon with a cypress stick. I can see how if you wanted a cozy building game that would be problematic, however. 

The part I didn't like, that they took out in the Switch version, was the timed challenges. I want to take my time to gather and build, so I hated that nonsense. 

If you haven't yet, give the second game a go. Builders 2 improves on the first one in every way. Your equipment doesn't break, your levels and equipment stay between chapters, your item stacks go to 999 instead of 99, you can build a lot higher and the townspeople rebuild if stuff gets busted in story fights.

There are two approaches to play the game:

- roleplay a made-up character with some lore, my current character is a necromancer Dark Elf who doesn't harm animals and therefor casts spells on them so they stop attacking him. Also summons his now dead old friend, a wolf, who helps him in fights. My character however will kill anyone harming any animal immediatly because of his hatred against those

- go in without a plan, just create a character who can fit your most liked playstyle and read some books, watch lore videos and enjoy the atmosphere or simply play the game while you're watching a stream or videos.

BUT: I uninstalled it after two hours because I've been fighting more with the controls than the opponents. Shooting is one thing. I've tried controller and aiming is obviously a bitch. Tried Keyboard and mouse and that's better.

But passing... on Keyboard and Mouse every time I tried passing the ball, it just went in a completely random direction.
It was similar on Controller, but not as bad, you just have to aim while running, then stop all input, then pass.

Why stop all input? Because after pressing pass, there is a small window where the input of your left stick is used to aim the shot. So if you're running left because you're  aiming into the centre of the field and then press pass without stopping input, you just pass it to their goalie.

And what was the problem with Keyboard and Mouse?
Well, simply put the aiming after pressing pass is done with the mouse. It took me like an hour to notice it, because ANY small input is taken. So if you click right mouse button to pass, and woth that move your mouse ever so slightly to the left,  the shot will also go there.

I have played and enjoyed games with these kind of forced actions, but in those games, they were so few, so those moment only became one small bad experience of a largely great one.

The game is gorgeous, and I'd love to explore it.

Horrible experience for the longest time because all his friends were sweaty assholes when it came to that game. Nobody let me learn anything and just sunk me in because I play other shooter games. 

 I'd play with them for over 2 years, I didn't understand Jack shit. You'd think I'd learn but no we'd run 3 games, I'd maybe get a lucky kill but still don't know the maps. It took until all of them got out of liking the game for a bit and me being bored enough to just try it out alone in casuals.

 Then and only then did I start to wrap my head around it because it wasn't forced on me. It was by my own volition. I went off on some games and then enjoyed playing it alone. The thing was, when I played with them before since I didn't know what to do they'd tell me who to go and who they need on the team. They'd tell me where to put stuff down. Then they'd tell me to sit in room holding 1 angle. Tell me to put a hole into a wall but not tell me why and also why there. 

 Alone, I actually got to run around and do my own stuff. Do I play the game anymore? Not really but I crave it every now and then. I actually taught some other friends how to play it too and they actually had fun because I wasn't just ordering them around like a lap dog.

Unfortunately it is written in such a way that it’s clear the writers find themselves terribly more clever than they actually are, the humor is very hit or miss, the actual mystery is terribly constructed and clearly an afterthought to trying hard to sound funny or smart.  It is a point and click adventure without the understanding of brevity being the soul of wit; it is verbosity manifest.

3453,gaming,mz6kc3w,t3_1lhoxch,"Despite being a big Assassin's Creed fan, I bounced hard off Assassin's Creed Valhalla. It's funny, because it was initially the same thing with AC Odyssey. I tried twice to get into that game and it just wasn't clicking. I put it away for a while and ended up coming back and the third time was the charm. Not sure how many hours I sunk in, but it was a lot - maybe around 100? Pretty much 100%ed the game. Maybe it was an issue of expectations. By the third time, I wasn't going into it looking for an AC game, just a historical/mythos larp through ancient Greece, and I ended up really enjoying it.

I thought it'd be the same with Valhalla, and was hoping that going into it not expecting it to be an AC game would make it click right away. Nope. My first bounce off was after maybe 6 or so hours. I was trying to clear out the home base land area you first sail to after getting out of the starting area. There was a moment when an area I thought I'd cleared out suddenly had materials or whatever to collect again, and I realized they were just going to keep spawning.  I think it hit me that this wasn't a game that respected my time. Materials would keep respawning because the game was meant to be played for a very long time - it was designed as a time sink. That, plus the fact that I had just watched that whole Vikings show and The Last Kingdom, so maybe I was just all Viking'd out. I've tried two or three times since then, but just never got hooked.

3518,gaming,mz60pvh,t3_1lhoxch,"I have two that immediately come to mind.

The first is the original XCOM: UFO Defense

A friend of mine has tried to get me into this game so many times and I always hear how it's one the best strategy games ever. But no matter how many times I attempt to play it, I always end up more confused than anything due the time-unit action/movement mechanic, similar looking soldier sprites, and said soldiers dying almost immediately after starting the mission before I have a chance to even make sense of anything. Meanwhile, I had no such issues with the modern games due to their streamlined two actions per turn  system and the ability to customize your soldiers appearance, which makes it easier to tell who's who.

The second is the Galactic Civilization series. 

I tried the second one because I thought the ship builder looked awesome and that the combat being revolved by a video simulation of the battle rather than directly controlling it was a neat concept, but despite the game having a ton of build-in tutorials on how to play it, I still couldn't figure out how to do anything in the game outside of making custom ships. And I know it's not strictly due to it being part of the 4X genre because I also tried Sword of the Stars, which, while I was still very bad at and had confusions regarding how certain things like the economy and terraforming systems worked, I was at least able to figure out enough of the basics to actually do things like expand my colonies and initiate combat in that one.",2025-06-22 07:29:19-08:00,Werewolfwrath,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz60pvh/,1

3531,gaming,mz627iu,t3_1lhoxch,"I was playing Return of the Obra Dinn. It's a mystery puzzle game where you have to piece together clues to figure out the full story of what happened on the Obra Dinn, a pirate ship. And the way the game works is you can look at a dead body and go back in time and get a small snippet of what was going on when that person died. And through those ""memories"" you're meant to piece together the full story.

Well I really liked the concept and the beginning of the game was great. There's an element where you have this picture of all of the crew with blurred out faced, and a separate list of names, but you don't know which name goes to which crew member. And once you have all of the clues to be able to attach a name to a face, the face in the picture unblurs.

At first the game was going great, I was piecing together clues and finding the right names for the crew members. But then the story started getting very complicated and there was memory after memory, going back in time over and over again with new information each time. It was quite overwhelming. And to top it off, there were a couple faces unblurred in the photograph. Meaning I was given enough information to name them. But I had 0 clues as to who they could be. I kept rewatching the memories over and over to try and find the clues I needed, but it didn't help. I got frustrated, and bounced off. And then, 2 years later, I thought I would give the game a second try and I did literally the exact same thing at the exact same spot.

1) out of whack difficulty where you get one-shot because you wandered into the wrong neighborhood or have to whittle away a million hp while rolling around and doing 1 damage per hit. 

2) constant time limits or a “deadly night” that makes everything feel stressful and too urgent to enjoy. 

3) being chased by unkillable enemies that you can’t get touched by or even seen by in some cases.

3720,gaming,mzb2oax,t1_mz9c1wb,"Honestly, that was my experience with Apex until I realized the important thing about these games.  It's not about survival, it's about the fights. If you go into the match planning to survive to the end, then you do things like avoid team fights and loot loot loot, then you're slow and rusty when it's time to fight. Rather, land somewhere semi-hot (hot drops are for madmen and bots), grab a few guns, and go for the sound of fighting. If you die, you reload and start again. If you survive, you get their loot and have one less team to fight. 


A lot of times, the reason why you get clapped in the later half is that while you played it safe and found good loot, the team that beats you has been killing people all match, and taking the best loot from people like you. So they're warmed up AND geared up. 


Not saying you should go back to BRs, I don't play them myself anymore either.

3784,gaming,mz65jdl,t3_1lhoxch,"Honestly BG3, I bought it at release and I'm happy having done that, but it felt inauthentic to DnD to me.

I wouldn't have needed them to do much for me as a player to feel like it was more DnD and less ""our Early Access first chapter that needed content density"" so they gave me the instructions to hurry up and wait. They scolded me when I took them seriously and rushed through seeking a cure to the plot device. They told me to go back and clean my plate, and even when I told them ""no, thanks"" they made me take some naps I had avoided because I was pretending the time crunch mattered.

I get it, I do, it's impossible to have content that both has time pressure and wants you to do everything before you progress? So, don't do that, maybe.

If they had just acknowledged that they were on the freaking ocean, and that a boat would get them right to Baldur's Gate, that might have been neat? As someone who lived on the ocean, you don't forget that it's there? More than that the road that was supposed to have been a major road was like a series of meandering circles because that was convenient for exploration? It slaughtered my suspension of disbelief like a babe in the cradle.

I'll go back to it one day when I want to combat slog before I experience real content. I'm glad it got a lot of people stoked for RPGs, but the last thing I think of when I think of DnD is a Divinity OS combat puzzle. I've literally never played at a table that didn't do any and everything they could to avoid combat, and the DM gives you XP for that, too? Like, WTF is the point of a CRPG if it's just a dice autoroller? I get that I can't say ""I've got a rope, let's tie them up"" when we take a prisoner who is obviously going to escape? That I accept, that's a CRPG's limitations. I'll carry a rope with me in a dozen games for every game that has an actual use for the rope anywhere.

But what I want from an RPG and what BG3 had on offer early on was a venn diagram I was on the wrong side of. I prefer games that let me have access to a city for civilization quests where I can talk to people and play a social character. D:OS and D:OS2 both do this, BG3 didn't because the first chapter isn't IMO built for a maximally engaging start to the game so much as it is a vertical slice, even the bits of civilization you get are scattered about like nuggets to find.

That's cool I guess? But it felt too much to me like the teacups and I was in the mood for a roller coaster, I get that the teacups would have let me off once I was good and dizzy, but I wasn't in the mood for that shit and if I can't RP what I'd prefer I can just -be- a bitter old man with better things to do.

Picked it up and was having a lot of fun with it but I noticed I wasn't making much progress with the combat. Looked up leveling up and combat and found that enemies levelled with you and if you had the wrong skills as major skills you could level up non combat stuff meaning the enemies would get stronger but you wouldn't.


What the actual fuck?


What a terrible mechanic to put in the game. Realised I'd basically have to restart my character but didn't really want to. The fun of levelling up is that you can feel stronger against enemies and feel like you're progressing. Sure in a lot of RPG games the difficulties ramp up through more difficult enemies, or more enemies and situations but you can still come across easier enemies and feel like a bit of a bad ass.


Also takes away that thrill in open world games where you take a wrong turn and go to an area you're not strong enough to fight yet and retreat. I still remember to this day in fallout 1 heading through necropolis and coming across a super mutant for the first time and dancing a flaming jig. You also get that the joy of coming back later and being able to handle it, seeing your progression.


I've never understood how people are so ok with oblivion and Skyrims levelling system.


At least in fallout 4 Bethesda learnt from this by just having more difficult enemy types show up when you levelled up so you could still destroy the scrubs.",2025-06-22 08:38:44-08:00,Inside_Swimming9552,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6e74e/,1

3961,gaming,mz6tizl,t1_mz61wlw,"Same. Started Doom Eternal, barely a hour in before I knew that it wasn't for me. Movement felt clunky, melee was worthless even against the weakest enemies (which instantly destroys any feeling of being powerful in the slightest), and you were practically *forced* to use the chainsaw (nothing screams ""skill"" more than ""you just don't have enough ammo to chew through health bars unless you use the unsatisfying panic-button option *every combat*"").

The artstyle had so many things ludicrously candy-colored, 13y.o.-style-edgy, and soulless: the amazing [possessed soldiers](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Possessed_Soldier) and [possessed](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/The_Possessed) from 2016 got replaced by these painfully generic looking [soldiers ](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier_(enemy))and [zombies](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_(Doom_Eternal)). Even [arachnotrons ](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Arachnotron/Doom_Eternal)were *goofy* instead of even remotely intimidating looking.

And if I only got this impression because I only played an hour: yes. Doom 2016 had an extremely tight, carefully choreographed intro and first few levels. That's part of why it was so great: it established the tone so effectively from the first minute on. If the game's first introduction is so sloppily done that it's actively repulsive and you have to push through it.... why *on earth* should I expect the rest of it to be any better?

If you had told me it was a cheap knockoff by another studio that was just trying to cash in on the Doom 2016 hype, I would have found it easier to believe than that it was the real sequel.

3964,gaming,mz95ygt,t1_mz8z5tw,"The most egregious cheap-knockoff vibes from Eternal came from the zombies, which the devs chose as their first-impression monster, which are not present in Doom 1 or 2, and most definitely didn't have to look as we-used-off-the-shelf-assets as they do. Just keeping 2016's Possessed design, with civilian clothes, would have been much better.

I don't see how you can say that 2016 didn't have a specific art style, especially if the comparison is Eternal, which uses all the same monsters, but uses a generic ""square headed man with gun and glowing eyes"" for its main fodder enemy.

Doom 2016 was visually distinct, and all the enemies have either a cohesive warped-flesh look (if they were former humans) or bone-straining-or-bursting-through-skin look if they're demon-demons (imp, mancubus, cacofiend, pinky). And almost all of their monsters were pulled from previous games.

*Not* from previous games:

* Hell Raiser (basically just the generic human, but able to appear in hell, because UAC soldiers in hell makes no sense).
* Hell Guard (a one-off boss)

Not relevant to compare:

* generic possessed human enemies (in every game, but rendered differently basically every time)

From previous games:

* Baron of Hell
* Cacodemon
* Cybermancubus/mancubus
* Cyberdemon
* Pinky/Spectre (though these are a cross between Doom 3's weird rendering and the original)

That’s very much so not the point of that scene, and I’m bothered that this became the popular interpretation. The slayer is only at that first panel because he’s trying to get a read on the situation, to get information. He smashes both screens because Hayden tries to give his spiel. They even drive the point home with the pan/glance down to the corpse in the elevator when he says they’re doing what they are for the good of humanity. It’s a dismissal of the clearly duplicitous character, not the plot.

4030,gaming,mz8136s,t1_mz61wlw,"Funny this question came up today of all times, I decided to give Doom Eternal another try last week after buying and hating it 3-4 years ago.

The first time I tried to play I absolutely hated it (even though I had loved Doom 2016), just hated the low ammo, 'pvp arenas' etc. I managed to play just 1 level a day and gave up on the 4th one.

The second time around I knew what I was in for, actually read the codex entries on the enemies about what their weakness was, and played the game exactly as the dev's forced you to play it...and did actually find myself enjoying it and finished the game in 2 sessions.

I still think the game is very flawed, you basically HAVE to do use every tool the game gives you in very specific ways. If you aren't using your grenades for Cacodemons, machine guns for the melee brutes, constantly using the flamer on cd for armor, chainsaw for ammo, and always running for your life you will lose.

Even with my second attempt there were still an even more annoying enemy I had yet to encounter. One that requires you to be patient while a ghost dog endless attacks every second and 10+ other demons are trying to eat your face off. Whoever added the Marauder can piss off, that thing is just not any fun at any time.

TLDR
Basically Doom Eternal was 'this game is super fun, just do exactly what we tell you too and you will enjoy'

2. Understanding all the boons and which synergies to work towards. Every 3-4th run you get a great build going that really carries you forward. This can feel very rewarding.

I played it for idk, maybe an hour? Idk if it was the controls, the character movement, I think there was a puzzle that I couldn’t figure out cuz it felt like I was missing some crucial piece of it. And being stuck meant backtracking, which was annoying. The combination of all that, I don’t think there was any moment where I was having fun or enjoying myself, so I just dropped it and never went back. Maybe if I felt like pulling up a guide it would have been a better experience, but I didn’t want to have to do that since the entire fun of solving puzzles is to find out the solution yourself.

There’s every possibility I’ll go back to it and it’ll become a favorite. I tried Dark Souls back when it was free for xbox live gold, idk like 10 years ago. Had zero fun, struggled with the tutorial boss, gave up. Finally tried it again this past December and I absolutely loved it.

4208,gaming,mz6myrw,t3_1lhoxch,"I think it's gotta be Expedition 33. An indie game with a AAA dev team? That promises on a good story, novel worldbuilding and good characterwork? And I get to play a turn-based RPG that lets you defend yourself on the enemy's turn? Sign me up!

Spoilers ahead.

Then I played the actual game. Only one of my expectations was met in decent characterwork, but the worldbuilding is entirely absent and limited to admittedly beautiful setpieces with zero explanation of the mechanics behind. Character attitude ping pongs between ""Everything here is deadly and one wrong step will be our doom"" to tongue and cheek competing with each other for who kills more supposedly deadly enemies.

The objective of expeditions in the game is to learn about this weird wonderful and dangerous world, but the characters act with either mild surprise or straight familiarity to literal eldritch horrors. The world has zero weight and frankly it makes it seem presumptuous. Fucking 70 expeditions died here and we are laughing at the enemies?

The story is the most whatever story I have ever seen. Nothing is explained about the mechanics in the world, except how the numbers work. It's just a ragtag team of idiots who wanna kill a god and act all the time as if it was trivial. There is some strong inquiry with the old man plotline but frankly it's so drip fed to you and tediously slow that it just didn't hook me enough before I abandoned the game. Maybe it gets interesting afterwards, but I'm not gonna bother checking it out.

I also strongly disliked the mechanics. The game has some very fucking tight parry windows, but I think anyone with some decent hand-eye coordination can get it done. My problem was that enemies have no substantial indication on when you need to parry them, and just love to feint and bait you into parrying early. So if you parry is not decided on if you can react to an attack, and instead on if you have learned the dumbass pattern or not. There is no room to get an edge on an enemy it is just ""oh I know when it's gonna hit"" so you press the button, pow, done.

And I think the devs knew how big of an issue this was because most boss enemies don't bother with all that. They just hit you normally, so you can parry or dodge on intuition and reflexes. Because learning the patterns of an enemy who you're fighting once isn't that fun on a turn-based game. I cannot believe Expedition 33 fumbles this when the Mario &amp; Luigi saga had been doing it masterfully for several years.

Oh, and the whole deal with weapons scaling with different stats is such a dogshit mechanic. So a character's weapon scales with agility or whatever and then you find another weapon that completely neuters your stat spread because it scales on defense? What's the point of speccing if you don't know if the best weapon in the game scales with some dump stat?

Oh but you can respec with a consumable. So because you found a new weapon that utterly outclasses what you had equipped now I need to spend an hour respeccing my entire party to properly fit this weird ass Agility/Luck reject that you've forced me to make.

Same with the abilities. A skill tree in which every character can do anything, with zero indication on what's good or isn't. And of course, you cAn rEsPeEecC!!

It feels like the game gives you zero guidance on what each character is designed to do because it's built to be enjoyed by the guys on their 23th playthrough who are bored of the standard way to play. In fact, it feels like a game with a class system that gives you an ability spreads for each class, but which has been modded to remove classes so that you can mix an match. Pókemon, Final Fantasy, Golden Sun and Bravely Default do the experimentation angle much better, and the limits in those games make choosing abilities much more interesting and complex.

And none of it matters anyways because if you become cracked at parrying you can just invest everything in Might and fucking destroy everything with basic attacks. Which you should be aiming to do anyways because decent ability-based strategies are entirely dependent on if you parry or not. So you're gonna get good at it.

What an absolutely disappointing, boring, superficial, presumptuous clunky waste of a game that had utterly immense potential. But hey it's kinda pretty and a couple of characters have depression so I'm sure it will win GotY.",2025-06-22 09:22:15-08:00,ArgetKnight,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6myrw/,1

I like RPGs, high difficulty, and gothic aesthetics so it seems a good fit.  I don't usually love action mechanics specifically but I've played a few such games now and then.

The PC controls were horrible though.   I messed with it for a few hours trying to get a feel for it in the tutorial area practicing on the skelitons there, but nothing I tried ever felt remotely right, much less fluid or responsive or generally *good*.  Definitely not remotely good *enough* for a game whose action combat mechanics were famously advertised to be built around correct timing of blocks and dodges.  I couldn't even remap key bindings which was extremely frustrating as an ESDF (rather than WASD) gamer and seemed to me to show a *serious* lack of care and basic effort for something that was advertised as a highly polished AAA experience.

Some online friends advised me to buy a controller and that it would be better playedike a pseudo console game that way but I don't want to do that.  Those things have always felt clunky and silly to me compared to mouse and keyboard.

So I figured if it was only playeable ""console style"" then it wasn't playable for me, and sent it back for my Steam refund.

The controls *sometimes* felt off for me, but it was rarely an issue, a lot of other people complain about the controls but it was never really an issue for me.

The big issue for me was the pacing. It's super slow, if you don't give a fuck about more than half the cast, you won't give a fuck about the game. It's mostly character-driven for the first few chapters rather than plot driven. The plot doesn't progress much until the end of chapters but characters progress a lot more. This is mostly how I felt and I haven't really seen anyone else argue this so I might just be saying shit.

Even with that being said, I'm currently at 100 hours in and it's still pretty fun. BTW, the game is long as fuck, completed it in 84 hours with maybe 20ish hours of side content.

I’m not opposed to turn based/strategy, or grinding, or more complicated combat, or anything like that as long as the rest of the game makes up for the parts I don’t 100% enjoy - but something about the Dragon Age series just feels off, it’s like Bethesda Jank but lacking charm. (Bethesda kinda suck at the moment too lol) The first 2 kinda feel like just ok ps2 games, like they’re not awful they’re just.. ok? And inquisition feels like it wants to be a cool open world game but there’s just something about it that feels lifeless. - I have even tried to add mods for QOL etc

However I decided to try the series ONCE AGAIN with Veilguard and I actually enjoyed this one, idk how to explain it but it’s the only one out of the series that’s genuinely fun to play, everything feels much smoother and refined and honestly just a solid simple rpg. It’s a shame because BioWare are supposedly masters of storytelling, but the gameplay just feels so weak. 

Give me Veilguard, with some of the previously missed out mechanics, and the solid story telling.

**Lost in Random** - Couldn't hook me quickly enough, seemed twee and annoying


**Evil West** - Soooo, I'm a cowboy... but I'm locked into a linear level progression that could've been in 2d it's so locked down, and I have no gun (at the start anyway), I punch things with a ... oh fuck off.


**Days Gone** - Sooo, this is the Pacific Northwest, huh? Lots of ... trees. When the scenery lulls you to sleep despite a zombie sprinting after you like a post-autopsy Ben Johnson on Stanozolol, man, that's a shit setting.


**Death Stranding (twice)** - So, I have to learn to...walk? While carrying a baby in a tube and occasionally being chased? All while some sort of blight continues that has maybe wiped out humanity... bah, no, fuck off, this is madness, I quit. 


**Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.** Sooo, Bjorn, it has been many moons since we last fought beside one another another. Yes, we do all sort of look and sound the same, with the same forceful projection, no vulnerability and... yes, Bjorn, I also wish we had some real character development and a discernible plot. But getting lost among the marshes while not really being sure what you're looking for almost makes up for the button mashing absence of any nuance in combat, so there's that... bleh. An ubisoft low, maybe, and that's saying something.


**Disco Elysium**. The sun dappled its way through lowered blinds, cutting me like a knife. Hangovers can be like that. I lay on the motel bed, wondering what her name had been, the stench of my whiskey breath no reason to stick around. Eventually, I'll get up, wander around a bit. The world outside will be in chaos. Somehow, I'll die eight times in the next six minutes, before getting remotely close to a plot, like some refugee from a Henry James novel. I go up to a guard to get help. He doesn't want to help. Ulp. Nine times. I quit. I barely have the patience for actual books these days, sooo, beloved as you are.... nope. 


**No Man's Sky.** I walk around. I dig. I find some stuff. I find a beacon. I get off the planet. I land on a space station where no one speaks any Earth language, or wants my stuff. I fly to another planet. I repeat. I wonder why I'm doing this. No man, no man's sky.


**Avowed**- Say! Hey there, partner! You must new in the city, see? That blight thing's pretty bad, huh? Fuck me. Abysmal writing, outdated mechanics, boring map, inert NPCS. What a piece of shit.


**Atomfall** - I'm walking, yes indeed, I'm thinking about Fallout 3, I'm walking yes indeed, indeed. I'm walking, yes indeed, I'm walking... wait... I'm just walking a lot, and killing the odd person. The setting is charming for about twelve minutes. And nothing here hasn't been done better a dozen times before.


**Hellblade** - Hello (hello, hello, hellooo....) Is there anybody out there (out there... out there... out there) who thinks a game about schizophrenia is sort of tasteless (tasteless, tasteless, tastelss). And boring. But pretty. Yeesh.


**Quantum Break**: So, it's sort of a digital movie, but also sort of an action game. It combines the acting of a Tubi b-flick with the controls of an early Resident Evil travesty. And it stars that guy... you know... that one. Pass.


**Star Wars Squadrons**: Just... dull, somehow. Shouldn't have been able to manage that but it made me weep for Tie Fighter.


**Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remaster**: Man, I put 600 hours into this on the 360, back in 2006. I am going to fucking love... nope, I'm just too familiar with all of it, still. Damn. Looks good, though.


**Wartales** - So, this will probably take me back to Odyssey: the Great Apventure back on the Apple II, a cool random-encounter role playing game that was mostly texts and sprites. But with cooler graphics. What? There's almost no story, anywhere? Or voicing? Or explanation of what's going on beyond the most basic CPRG possible? Ye gads.


**Forza Horizons 5**: Heeeey, cool dudes! Time to get radical with this totally hyper badass racing game! So let's get down to the festival, and chart some gnarly... what?... What's that?... Youd... rather I just fuck off with my brosephs? Okay, old dude, like, whatever man. That's just your opinion, man. I'm going to go stand a mile over there, man, because that's, like, as far as the map goes.

Fans all said, ""It gets amazing 30 hours in!"" Yeah, no.

Battle Royale was the first genre that made me feel like an old man for not getting it. It's oldschool every man for himself 90s FPS deathmatch...but slower and more boring? 10 minute walking sims until a sniper you can't see kills you and you get the start the entire queuing process over again.

The entire autobattler genre- Teamfight Tactics and Underlords. It's like combining the most boring parts of 2 1/2 genres with none of the fun.

4570,gaming,mz6xtu8,t3_1lhoxch,"I held off on playing The Last of Us for a decade. Not really on purpose, but because it just didn’t interest me. I tend to hate zombie media, and it just didn’t really look like my type of game. And for me a big part of it was how much emphasis was put on the graphics. A year after launch they put a remastered version on the new console I didn’t have, and for the next decade every time I got a new console they had already released an update for the next one. But in 2023 the show had come out, everyone wanted to watch and talk about it, I had avoided spoilers for a decade, I had just gotten a PS5, and they had just released a PS5 remake, so it felt like everything had fallen into place and the time was right, so I played through the game and DLC for the first time.

Afterward I figured “might as well play the second game” so I started it, but very quickly I lost interest and never came back. This was very early in the first chapter when the game was still in tutorial mode, before any of the plot actually happened. I really didn’t care for the first game that much, but I powered through so that I could watch the show. It reminded me of how Nintendo fanboys oversold Breath of the Wild and said it was the best and most realistic and lived-in open world ever, but then when I played it the world between the towns and quest locations was barren and empty and I realized they just said that because they’ve only ever had Nintendo consoles so this is their first experience with an open world game. Maybe if you had never played a narrative game before The Last of Us would have seemed revolutionary and groundbreaking, but those are almost all I play so to me it was very mediocre, and to borrow a dead meme because I don’t know how else to describe it, it “insists upon itself”. I guess that’s the big difference in this analogy, because I did enjoy Breath of the Wild in spite of the open world being oversold, but The Last of Us was a letdown *because* of how oversold it was.

So all that is to say that the reason I “bounced off” the sequel was just that the game was too similar to the first game, with the same clunky mechanics and unworkable mashup of genres and narrative/character problems and self-seriousness. It’s hard for me to talk about this game without going on a wall of text rant that surpasses the Reddit comment length limit, and it’s hard for anyone to criticize the game without risking coming across as a capital G Gamer who has never touched grass. But none of that part of the game had even happened yet.

But unexpectedly it only took two years for the second season of the TV show to come out (how crazy would that sentence sound a decade ago?), so recently I forced myself to get back into the game to actually play it all the way through. The more I played it the more I hated it and should have “bounced off”, but I kept pushing and now I can say without a doubt that it’s the worst AAA game I’ve ever played all the way through. And I could probably remove the AAA part. Thinking back on it with hindsight I probably would have “bounced off” the first game too if I hadn’t been pushing through to watch the TV show, I found that game to be a frustrating slog but not quite as bad as the sequel (and in terms of some of the really awful gameplay mechanics decisions it gets more of a pass for being from 2013 and not 2020, by which point the developers should have known better). But I don’t know, I guess I’m stubborn. I don’t want a TV show adaptation to be how I learn major plot points of a video game, and even if I avoid the TV show I *really* don’t want memes of a TV show of a game to be how I learn major plot points. So that’s why I pushed myself so hard to play two games I really despised.

Thankfully I’m done with the series now, and I really hope that Druckmann’s hints that there may not be another game and any future installments would be part of the TV show holds true. I do think The Last of Us works much better as a TV show than as a game, I still have a lot of issues with the narrative and tone and characters but many of my problems are with the gameplay and structure and the notorious Naughty Dog disconnect between gameplay and cutscenes, and at least those aspects don’t exist in the show. Narratively it’s also much more straightforward and less problematic to depict a character committing atrocities as part of a message why that’s wrong than to force the player (as the character) to commit those atrocities and then scold them on why that was bad. So yeah, this property always should have been a show or movie and never should have been a game at all.

But now I’m really curious about Intergalactic. Because The Last of Us was always going to be an uphill battle for me, a gritty and overly serious zombie game built around clunky mechanics and insufferable characters never had a chance of being appealing to me. But strip that away and replace it with a quirky retrofuturistic setting and what appears to be a more lighthearted action-adventure game and it is way more suited to my tastes. So when it finally comes out this game will answer something that The Last of Us made me wonder: do I hate The Last of Us, or do I just hate Naughty Dog games? Time will tell.",2025-06-22 10:15:17-08:00,obi1kenobi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6xtu8/,1

4633,gaming,mz6nb0o,t3_1lhoxch,"I still feel guilty about it but Hypercharge: Unboxed is the only game I bought and then promptly returned via steam's first time ""everyone gets one"" return request. I normally don't buy games based off of ads but I saw a clip and fell in love with the concept. On paper, action figure themed shooter sounded like the perfect idea and I think the game did do whatever I expected it to do so it wasn't bad but it didn't take me long to realize that I just impulse purchased a game I never heard about solely on what I wanted it to be in my head. I knew it wasn't going to stand up against my other shooters on concept alone and I guess I would have liked just something extra to hook me outside of just lobby based arena pvp action 

Now though, I'm looking at the steam page for it and my brain wants to be swayed again haha - it looks so much shinier now and the action figures look great. It just looks like a fun idea! (and the reviews still seem solid so I recommend anyone else to check it out, at least)  
  
I've bought games like Helldivers 2/Diablo 4 that I quickly stopped playing despite enjoying them an average amount but I guess with this one, the big difference was a feeling that the game might not expand much more beyond its initial pitch vs these other titles that will inevitably keep funding and updating itself until it finds its way back on my radar. That could be a big plus for many other players since I think these days, people want to get a game that is fun and not worry about battlepasses/seasons/etc forcing you to log in every day so again, definitely give it a look - I'd love to see this game expand further, one day!",2025-06-22 09:23:52-08:00,Sokodile,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz6nb0o/,1

Sitting down and eating soup to regenerate mana 5 times per dungeon. Running for 15 minutes back to your grave. 20 minutes to get to the next zone. It’s miserable. And why tf do I need 30 abilities? Why are these guides telling me to use 7 different buttons on my mouse while holding down alt, Ctrl, or shift instead of using my keyboard? Wtf are all these add ons I need to use and learn? I just got denied a raid because I don’t have an achievement? Why am I not allowed to move for 30 seconds in PvP? I’ll take a nap, wake up, and I’m still regening mana or binded when I wake up.

It's just so...ugly. There's all these sharp particle effects floating around in every single scene, and EVERY element of the UI is animated in a ""sketchy"" style. Nothing is ever standing still in that fucking game. Everything's flashing and jittering around, I couldn't get an hour in before the headache.

Maybe there's a mod or two now to calm things the fuck down, but the game's unplayable with how it looks. Like, I get the shiny glass shards floating everywhere are the game's ""magic,"" but that's fucking dumb and ugly and you could have just had characters say ""boy it sure feels magical as shit in here"" without the particle effects in EVERY scene.

I don't get how so many people breathlessly praised its UI. Persona 5's UI is great, nigh perfect. Metaphor's is absolute garbage and a textbook case for why ""less is more"" is a thing. I feel like the only reason people say Metaphor's UI design is great is because it's riding on P5's coattails.

I've got no beef with the gameplay and I didn't get far enough to even consider the writing. My beef is purely with the visuals. Just give me an option to turn off the particle effects and make the UI elements static and I'll give it another chance. I literally cannot play the game as it stands out of the box without getting a massive headache.

At one point I noticed that I hadn't booted my 360 in over six months. I did have other games (Dead Rising, The Godfather, others I forget), but GTA4 was the last game I ever bought for the system. Not only did I lose interest in that game, but it also killed my desire to stay current with present day game generations. I ended up selling the 360 before RE5 even came out, and I never ended up playing that game, either.

Tried it twice, didn't like it.

I don't need a good story in a game, it's a big plus if a game has story and I like it.


But WoW is one of those rare games I really don't like anything about it's story or the pacing of it, the issue is that game specifically because I have played games with ""meh"" story in my opinion, and never had the same negative feeling like with WoW.

If you didn't mind the combat or actually liked it... Maybe give Elden Ring a try someday. It's just better than Dark Souls in every way.

There isn't really anything forcing you to a very specific path and there is lots to do but it's still a game that you have to like the core gameplay of.

A lot of people are too used to linear games, I had to remind friends multiple times that Elden Ring is open world, if a section is too hard or frustrating, go explore something else.

4880,gaming,mz7zwbm,t3_1lhoxch,"RPGs and open world games in general. I definitely have finished some of the best of the best in these genres but it takes me years to get through them. Biggest example is most souls likes compared to Elden Ring. I beat Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Lies of P all within a month or so of starting them. Elden Ring I’m still not finished with. 

It feels almost too open ended for me and I always feel like I’m making the wrong choice. Finding out I missed a quest in Lies of P is slightly annoying but I know I can brute force my way through NG+ to get it. That same thing happening in a game like Elden Ring where I now have to do another 150 hour long play through? Fuck that shit, I’m looking at the wiki before moving onto the next dungeon.

I was so ready to be submerged in this turn-based strategy. And sure, I was ready for a challenge. But man, that turn counter limit ruined the entire experience so quickly. It´s sooooo restrictive. It leaves no room for any other strategy than the one the game developers had in mind. No ""oh, what if I try that for a change?"". It´s basically a puzzle with one perfect solution (and a couple of miserable but not fatal ones) instead of a truly strategic game where you can put a bit of yourself in it.

4960,gaming,mz84db1,t3_1lhoxch,"**Rust.**  How the hell does it have so many players?

First of all, I don't really like games where other players can loot my corpse or rob me of anything (*other than my time*).    It doesn't feel good to start with nothing but a rock and find out people are enjoying picking off fresh spawns from a distance with assault rifles.  It's worse than early PVP WoW and rogues ganking people in low level starting areas.  This is especially true in games with persistent environments.  It's not so bad dying in Counter-Strike and having your weapon stolen, because you will be re-armed by the next time you meet that guy.   He didn't take something from you that you put in serious effort to obtain.

You can't really play with friends unless you're playing the game heavily modded, because good luck finding them.  Respawning at random places unlikely to be close to your group or base also sucks.

And honestly, 've played plenty of games where I started with ""nothing"" but did not feature my character's genitals being exposed.   Being explicitly naked adds nothing to the game, but makes it a game I can't enjoy around certain people who might otherwise be interested",2025-06-22 13:56:43-08:00,JudgeJudyApproved,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz84db1/,18

And while people who enjoy sports games can also happen to be gamers, the games themselves are not marketed for gamers but for sports fans, which is perfectly fine if there's an audience then there's an incentive, but imo as an unfortunate result for the target audience being much larger than that of your average gamer-oriented game, the companies who make these (mainly EA) have turned into companies that only care about grabbing cash and popping out yearly titles to stay on top of the trends, which in turn made them utterly garbage at marketing or even releasing actual good old videogames.",2025-06-22 08:11:01-08:00,Nyarlathotep7777,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz68umw/,2

I actually managed to find a way to get back into it with a couple mods to increase the difficulty. 


Dropped ore generation rates, upped monster agrro range. And gave zombies the ability to dig (very slowly) 


And I gotta tell you, needing walls and being forced to consider defense when building your cool structures really fixed that defect for me. I love it now. Building feels so much more fun now that I know that zombies could dig a hole under my base and lead a party of 10 creepers into my chest room and set me back to the stone age. 


I don't think people realize how much of the difficulty of Minecraft comes from the aggro range. In vanilla its pitiful. Like 30 blocks. Once it's 128 with monsters getting X-ray vision. Every night is like a horror movie. Skeletons firing off from the hills way off in the darkness, spiders swarming and jumping you when you thought you were safe behind your walls. Zombies slowly but surely digging big holes that shade them from the sun. Something you gotta take care of within two to three days if you don't want a massive breach.

I got Doom for switch shortly before Eternal came out. I was excited for Eternal but didn't have anything that could run it properly. I got a Steamdeck and my first purchase with it was Doom Eternal.

Not really gonna explain it but level design, AI, viable tactics etc all play a role in what makes a shooter great. It’s why the original Halo is lauded and the non-Bungie sequels aren’t.

Dark Souls - legit broke a controller my first go at it. Fast forward about two years, figured I'd give it another go (I spent the money on it damnit). Now I've logged more hours in Soulsborne games than any other franchise and love the hell out of em.

SotE - When I walked into the DLC with a lv200 character, full kit, optimized stats.... only to get completely undressed by some random enemy, yeah f no. I've only grudgingly completed it months later. I will endlessly complete more ng+ cycles on the main Elden Ring game, but under no circumstances will I replay the DLC. Don't get me wrong, the aesthetic is phenomenal. The lore, engaging and beautifully written. *Some* of the boss fights, immeasurably satisfying. I cannot fathom why an existing character that performs perfectly well in the base game, is rendered nearly ineffectual based on a mechanic that requires you to collect 50 more tree fragments in order to *feel* at parody (just for you mind you, there's another set separate for your spirit summons).

5422,gaming,mz90gvq,t3_1lhoxch,"In terms of games, either Monster Hunter World or Diablo 4. These are games that, by my preferences, I should like. Monster Hunter World has action combat, grinding, progression. D4 has these as well, plus I thoroughly enjoyed D3 and have enjoyed bursts of PoE).

In the case of both, they ended up being seemingly over-complex. D3 was enjoyable for me because in many ways it was largely casual. I could come back once or twice a year, play for a season, then put it away for a bit. Even if a fair few abilities and armor pieces had changed, it was simple enough I could pick things back up. Even from the drop, D4 was more complicated with its abilities and talents - it was like they tried to go somewhere between D3 and PoE, and for me - if I wanted to go the light end, I'd go D3, if I wanted the extreme end I'd go PoE; why would I jump in between the two?

For MHW, it just throws so much at a new player. Once you get into the groove and learn all those things I'm sure it's quite good, but with so many games in my library to catch up on and play, I didn't have the patience for it.

I would suggest editing a map to add extra resources in your staring area, and to play in peaceful mode (no biters).  This allows you to learn the mechanics of the game without having the stress of being attacked.  Once you become more familiar with the recipes and how to set up your automation, you can start another game and turn biters back on.  You can modify how quickly (if at all) the enemies grow stronger and expand, too.  Once you’re used to all of it, you can play on normal settings.  If you master that, you can try more advanced scenarios like a death world.

Honestly I enjoy playing it in peaceful mode the most.  I am much more interested in building than defending.

Yes, I know it would be sacrilegious for someone, but after looking at the game, I think it's title of ""Diablo 2's true successor"" is seen through rose tinted glasses of disappointed fans that were trying to cope with the (rightfully) disappointment that was Diablo 3 by labelling things that's remotely diablo-like as D2's successor of sonekind. I had never felt so disappointed in a game that was held up as a shining example of ARPGs.

Ironically, it's probably mainly the comparison between it and Diablo 2 that it crashed hard with me; it wasn't Diablo 2 at all besides gear having holes for you to put stuff into, in fact, the atlas system functioned closer to Diablo 3's greater rift than anything diablo 2 ever did.

Ironically still, I am enjoying PoE 2 more, because it actually plays closer to Diablo 2 than PoE 1 was, despite many reservations that PoE 1 players have of PoE 2.

I only started playing 2 at the start of Dawn of the Hunt league, and I would not be surprised if I already put in more hours in PoE 2 than I did PoE 1.

Ps. The fact that I had to drop down my map progress by three tiers because there was nothing higher dropping, and I had to do it twice during one of the earlier league days didn't help. When it happened the third time, I actually concluded this system was far worse than Diablo 3's and put it down for a good few years.

At this point in my original game I basically can keep it running in the background and just check in once in a while to see if some of my science pack factories have stopped for some reason and fix whatever that is.

The weird thing is, all the vehicles and armor sets and whatnot, at some point I just stopped using them because more or less the entire later game can be played standing still at the spawn point and doing everything via the remote map.

God smite who ever designed the picto, lumina, and weapon systems. The UI that has to accompany these systems. It's just such a chore.

The combat was fun for a while, but I just felt this overwhelming sense of boredom part way through the game.

5628,gaming,mz88rrc,t3_1lhoxch,"Diablo 4. Great concept, horrific execution in almost every way including what should be foundational to any video game.

As someone who doesn't just like to mindlessly copy other builds from the internet, but instead actually play around with builds and respecing and different gear, and refocusing on different stats to earn my way to the highest DPS I can deal. YOU CAN'T in this game. So i don't get the point. The whole joy of games like this should be the math. The math is all broken and abstracted and even lies on the screen where some aspects don't even show up in your stats or your buffs don't all show up. 

The way the damage multiplies is abstracted from the user (other than 'damage bucket' theories out there on forums that apparently aren't even true anymore). You can't track your dps or parse your damage (other than guessing at a practice dummy if it looks like more or less than you remember it doing before). Or maybe sometimes, based on what you have observed, your build should be high af dps, then you switch weapons to some other completely random one and appear to be doing exponentially higher damage than what theoretically even makes sense, especially if it's a mythic weapon even tho that forfeits two other aspects that procs off your abilities and stats that should have benefited you more. Wtaf. 

This game is for people who are too drunk to care and just passing time, or noobs who haven't experienced what a game should be like or something and just want to look cool playing a game that has demon imagery like some kind of edge lord. It's hardly a game, and I don't get the appeal in having the problem solving aspect of a game taken away from you. Over my life I've played countless video games, because playing challenging video games is a passion of mine, and all the most base concepts that makes a game good, the diablo 4 people threw out the window. Idk why these big AAA studio's keep pumping out trash like this or worse, but it's so dishonest and deceptive. 

I suppose I shouldn't be suprised tho as an American because some of my favorite games are jrpg's that performed piss poor here in the US market english releases, while teh studios less popular games performed better here in the US, because US players apparently tend to prefer linear story-following gameplay and mindlessly and have their hand held while being shown hyper realistic CGI, instead of open world strategy. That's exactly why final fantasy did so well here while squareenix other more amazing games with more complicated mechanics shriveled up and died on the US markets. Same with Tri-Ace.",2025-06-22 14:21:06-08:00,SatisfactionNo2088,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz88rrc/,1

I LOVE this game, I think it’s one of the coolest puzzle games of all time, but as you get into the late game, it becomes more of a time-sink to solve puzzles. There’s plenty of things that mitigate the RNG of it all, but not quite enough to make it easy to solve a given puzzle on one specific day.  Some puzzles seem very obtuse given the amount of red herrings and then you solve them and then you go “…that’s it? That’s the solution?” (Looking at you, safes) With that being said, I think the story is actually really compelling, and I love twisting the story out of many things you find along the way. 

I love that it is just piles of puzzles upon puzzles upon puzzles. I’ve put about 75 hours into the game and spent much more time speculating about the game during my non-gaming hours, and it has created a lot of camaraderie between a few friends and family and I where we are trying to solve puzzles together.

After like a year of waiting for it to go on sale, I got to try it for free. And not even 5 minutes after I created my character I knew it was not for me. Mostly due to the movement during combat.

Before the stans come for me, I'm not saying the game is bad. I'm saying if I wanted to eat sleep and do wash I'd play the sims. There is a growing trend where the ""mode"" for extreme difficulty is not a mode, it's part of the gameplay because they think that makes a game ""good."". I play games for short bursts with my schedule, so the need to sit down and craft 50 potions by hand so later on (on a separate playtime because I had to spend my time this playtime making potions) I can save when I have to inevitably put the game away immediately kinda discourages me. 

I know many people I know who love the game have said it gets easier and less of a nuisance as you play on, but I'll pass on this required nonsense as part of ""immersion."" I am perfectly able to become immersed in Skyrim and the like with their wacky ass physics, I don't need to be told to take a bath for immersion. I fully respected fallout having a survival mode.

The tutorial is incredibly terrible, as if its goal was to convince people **not** to play the game.

The keyboard commands are irrational (viewed as an English speaker), as if it was developed in some other language (it was, I’m told) and the shortcut is for *that* language’s word for the action, not the English word for the action. Making them effectively random.

My son absolutely loves Factorio so I’m forcing myself to occasionally try it again. Always from the beginning, because I die so quickly, and I’m told the beginning is the worst part. And that, boys and girls, is **not** how you design a game, with the first part sucking the most. Chase away those new customers! Make them regret their purchase! Well done!

I loved Shadow of the Colossus, I loved other games the studio put out but... fucking hell that was not a PS4 game.

It felt like a PS3 launch title that had buggy controls and poor game movement. There were times I jumped and fell and got hurt and then other times I jumped and made wider gaps. I felt like my character was running over landscape instead of walking on it. The camera controls infuriated me in a super short amount of time. I wanted to look a certain direction and felt like I was battling the camera to line up movement and jumps. It shouldn't have been that difficult on a late title PS4 game.

It felt 10 years old on day one, and I was pissed I spent new game money on it. 

If it'd come out 10 years prior, I probably would've liked it a lot. Given it a chance. I was so pissed at the wonky camera and inconsistent range of jumps... I just felt angry I spent so much money for that experience. I immediately gave up.

If I spend $60 for a new game from a AAA studio, I expect a $60 AAA game. The controls just weren't there, the camera was stupid and I got annoyed and quit.

I have played older games and had a better time just playing the game. I'm sure the story would've been great if I finished it but I don't want to fight the game the whole way. I felt I'd be fighting the poor game controls the entire time and bowed out early.

I'm going to cheat a little with the rules here. I SUSPECTED I wouldn't like it, but for the first time, I decided to test my sussing skills. 

It was everything I suspected it would be. A younger person with less gaming experience might actually enjoy the plot, but to me, it was a re-realease of ""generic AAA"". 

I've played SO many ""corpos are bad"" style plots. I grew up watching movies with this plot. My Saturday morning cartoon villains immersed me in this exact story so many times, that i was actually angry that this was the route the ""writers"" took. 

...It was BAD! It had no fire!  
No energy! No Nuthin! 

The game play was typical AAA. you follow the story, you pick stuff up, talk to people, upgrade things, maybe climb a radio tower, go on quests in a corpo world....?  
  
I LIVE in a corpo world! No! Bad game! 

If I could give an award for the dullest generic AAA release, it would be outer worlds. I deleted it after 20-30 minutes. Between all the corpo nonsense, and the knowledge that there was nothing new to experience...I bounced. And I don't bounce often.

Keep in mind I once enjoyed Assassins Creed, am playing DS1 and somewhat like it and don't really care about graphics. 



A less easy answer for me would be Wind Waker. I've been trying to beat every Zelda I missed and replay the ones I beat as a child (I have like 6 left, but only Zelda 2 is mainline). I fell off Wind Waker so hard after the first 60% or so on my last playthrough. I had beat it on GC as a kid, GC as a teen and Wii U as a adult. Playing now and after Skyward Sword it just couldn't keep me in. I did end up beating it, but that was me being OCD and ended up taking 5 times longer than expected (like 7 hours for the tri force quest) because I kept looking at my phone. It's just sailing, talking, easy puzzle, kinda cool combat, repeat. It offers nothing outside of charm when compared to other 3D Zelda games. I felt the same way about MM, but the day system at least kept me around. Wind Waker ended up taking me like 40 hours over 8 months.

Any scary game? 

I don't do horror games well. Even the opening portions of death stranding were to much for me. 


Dark souls. 

Got into the game because everyone said the lore was crazy deep. Got passed the tutorial and just realized I wasn't enjoying it, and from my understanding the core gameplay wasn't different across any of the games. 

Actually, this one was super useful. The two issues I had with the game was the trek back to your body where you had to be careful to not die again, though I could get used to this, I grew up playing diablo 2 (and being pretty bad at it) 

The other thing I didn't like and couldn't get past, was the stamina drain to Dodge. And this actually ended up being a key factor I quite dislike across many games.

Death stranding. Put like 15 hours into. Tried to RP in my head to get myself excited about it. Beautiful game. Just couldn’t do it. I work full time and it didn’t provide enough engagement for the time I actually had to play. Sorta like a tv series that takes 5 episodes to crack into the excitement. 

Assassins creed shadows. Oooooo I wanted so bad to love this game. SO BADLY. Paid the $70 like nothing. First AC game. I’ll eat up anything samurai. Spoiler alert. Got into the main middle chunk of the game after the intro. Just got lost in the lack of linear storyline. Found myself skipping cutscenes and not giving af about what was going on. The gameplay became grueling and monotonous. Found myself loading up to play and then “eh I’ll just watch some tv instead”. 

Lastly.. Elden ring. I watched EVERYTHING about this game. Took a year to talk myself into it. “I can do it”. Finally bought it. Told my wife “I can’t believe I’m doing this, this is like a real hard game”.  I talked to all my gaming friends about it. I spent all my time not playing by watching videos and tutorials. In fact I ended up spending more time watching ER YouTube videos than I did playing. Came to a point where I was just scared to do anything or go anywhere with it. I have nothing negative to say about the game at all. It’s beautiful. The lore is *chefs kiss*. Everything about it is perfect. It’s just not a game for people like me.

I'm a big Kojima and Metal Gear fan so when DS finally came out, I couldn't believe that so many people disliked it and I really thought they were all wrong. I had a PS4 back in the day but I didn't have the time or the money to try it out so I decided to wait for a couple of years.

In 2023, I found a used copy for fairly cheap and yet I still didn't try it out because I was busy with other games. I finally decided to check it out last month, since the sequel was coming out in June and every trailer looked absolutely insane...

I really wanted to like Death Stranding but I just couldn't. I spent like 7/8 hours in that game and it was just frustrating for me. I didn't mind the slow pacing or the weird story, I just really hate survival games with a big focus on resource management. When it finally dawned on me that DS is exactly that, I realized why it wasn't clicking for me. Like you said, I don't think it's a bad game (far from it) it just not for me.

It's a real shame, because I kept seeing people who say that, when DS clicks for you, it REALLY clicks.",2025-06-22 11:01:13-08:00,PraiseKingGhidorah,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz76shn/,1

6738,gaming,mze8dfw,t1_mzdu0wa,"Tips if you want to try the Gloomhaven series:

Start with Jaws of the Lion, it ease you into the rules and give a smoother experience. Going directly to Gloomhaven is brutal!

Play regularly, at least twice a month, preferable once a week, to keep the game, rules and current scenarios fresh in memory.

Play with people who live close, have time and mentality for co-op adventure games. It is not good for morale or gameplay if someone suddenly jump ship.

 Split the responsibility for the ""logistics"". Ex. one player do the board/figure setup and elements during play while the other take monster decks setup and turn cards during play. It gives faster setup and smoother gameplay for everybody. Work out what suites best for your group.

Buy an extra map with removable stickers (a must for JotL) if you want to replay it, as introduction to new players. If you go to Gloomhaven/Frosthaven it is more difficult logistically to replay, but possible.

Some of my friends wanted to give Dune a try. I figured why not. As soon as I was out in the world, after the brief tutorial I was like: ""okay, now what."" And it was the same old story. Gather materials, build a base, research new stuff to build, rinse and repeat. There are dungeons and stuff as well but it all just feeds into this core loop of trying to build the biggest base.

In general: these real-time menuing ""turn based"" games.    
 I love turn based combat, pokemon, SMT. But it's not really turn based if it skips your turn for taking longer than 3 seconds to root thru your bag for a potion.    
    
Games that try to circumvent this real-time menuing still haven't been great, but I've found more palatable. Pokemon Legends: Arceus has many issues, but the idea of menuing between smoke bombs and berries and pokeballs while dodging is just nonsense. But luckily, that play pattern is easily ignorable because there's other play patterns. Spent most the game sneaking and clobberin them over the back of the head with a heavy ball. Oddly enough almost feeling playing thru Final Fantasy 13 at the moment. The menuing mostly being just swapping between different auto-battle auto-pilots.

I keep hearing about how great FS games are, but bashing my skull into a boss over and over to try to learn the patterns just isn't the kind of experience I want out of a game. Elden Ring made it even worse with how long enemies are allowed to delay their attacks. I have no idea if they've fixed it since I last tried to play, but bosses would legit delay their attack for so long they'd just give up on even trying to do it and immediately switch to something else unless you locked yourself into something that couldn't be cancelled like healing. I also feel like the games aren't actually that hard, they're memorization checks and ""how well can you fight jank controls?""

Also, not necessarily the game's fault but the FromSoft community is incredibly annoying. Everything is met with a ""git gud,"" and if you point that out then all you'll get are a bunch of ""well it's true.""

I know it has quite the following but for me it does absolutely nothing. It´s such a huge departure from Super Metroid on the SNES and what made that game imho so great and unique: the branching paths, the back tracking, the absolute absence of any dialog, the environmental story-telling.

Instead Fusion is all blah blah blah, it´s linear af with ""sectors"" you have to complete in order, and it has... (in-game) cut-scenes!

It looks great, I´ll give it that. But it´s arguably not a ""true"" Metroidvania which is pretty ironic.",2025-06-22 15:33:55-08:00,KeplerFinn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz8lgse/,1

I've given it a shot multiple times over the years, but every time I play it, I get about 5 minutes in and remember that I really dont like it. It's not that it's bad, but it's just so slow and tedious at nearly all points in the game while also being really infuriating unless you turn off loot drop. All day and all night, there are creepers spawning, which can blow up half your base in seconds. Not to mention that getting any sort of enchantments can be a super slow and tedious process that may or may not involve some serious RNG. The best part, imo is being underground mining for a few hours while my friends do the rest.
It's a little odd, seeing as I really like terraria, but I find terraria to be a lot more entertaining, challenging, and rewarding while not feeling nearly as tedious or time consuming.",2025-06-24 10:33:20-08:00,AigaionAgain,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mzk4oop/,1

I'm on my little raft, trying to figure out how it steers and such and I trepidamtly sail put onto the open sea.

I ended up playing for two or three hours before stopping and playing something else while the other three continued into the night. I never touched it again, and I've never had an interest in MMOs since.

As a long time MK fan, the tutorial rubbed me off the wrong way and felt off for some reason. Felt like that I needed to learn too much to avoid getting pulped by the first Lv1 CPU. MK was always my braindead fun simulator and now this became too cerebral. Would have refunded if it wasn't part of a bundle of Klassic Arcade ports.

And, as a genre in general, MOBAs.

Toxic multiplayer culture and a base game I should like but for some weird reason I don't (loved playing Starcraft and Warcraft so I thought I would enjoy DotA at least) makes for a losing combination. 

There's something lost in the sauce with a champion-centric design, because for other games I can just barely endure multiplayer shenanigans if I enjoy the core gameplay, like Minecraft, which no amount of grifting and mod powertripping will stop me from enjoying mining and crafting.",2025-06-22 10:47:21-08:00,GostBoster,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz7436r/,1

The only time you need to analyze is through weapon passives. Also Nightreign is designed more for the fans who have played a lot of Elden Ring but wanted a fresh experience. In short, it gets fun the more meta knowledge you collect.

It's come up again recently because there's a lot of hubbub with the latest manga developments - so I read the latest 3 or 4 chapters just to make sure I wasn't missing any short term context, and yeah, guy still seems pretty unlikable.

It's going from a superpowered anime murderbot to playing Greg, the guy who stocks shelves at the grocery store. I went through a few of them and saw them as a speedbump to the good parts of the game, but they just keep happening and you can't progress the main story without doing more of those levels, and then I spent weeks farming for stuff to make that experience less terrible and it's STILL TERRIBLE, so like.... nope, done, enjoy the $25, Digital Extremes, hope your next game is better.",2025-06-22 11:41:06-08:00,lich_lord_cuddles,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lhoxch/whats_the_hardest_you_have_ever_bounced_off_of_a/mz7egak/,1

Maybe when I have some time to myself and wife and kids are away for a weekend I’ll give it another try but for now it’s a no. 

Come to think of it, most games that require a bigger investment are like that for me lately. 
I always enjoy them when I have the time to get invested, learn the mechanics etc and then when I am in the “flow” it gets easier. Like BG3 for example or more recently Cyberpunk. Took me over a year for each to finally get started in earnest. You can’t just play those casually. Not until you invest say 3-4 hours in one session and you get into the groove or flow. From then on it’s easier to just continue for an hour or so.
