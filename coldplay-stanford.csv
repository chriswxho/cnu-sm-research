Stadium FAQ: Clear Bag Policy Etc....

10pm noise curfew, 2 minutes of fireworks at the end of each show.

[https://www.caltrain.com/location/stanford-stadium?active\_tab=route\_map\_tab&amp;zoom=17.00&amp;center=-122.15803%7E37.43423](https://www.caltrain.com/location/stanford-stadium?active_tab=route_map_tab&amp;zoom=17.00&amp;center=-122.15803%7E37.43423)

Caltrain Info: Parking is $80-240 (!!!!!) Caltrain ~~is adding a special stop a short walk from the stadium~~ stops at Palo Alto Station across El Camino Real from the Stanford campus and stadium.  I highly recommend this option. Bay Area traffic is notorious on a good day, and Caltrain is accessible in other Bay Area locations and you can transfer from BART Bay Area Rapid Transit.

Open containers of alcohol are allowed until 9pm and CALTRAIN is giving away bandanas as well.

If you must travel by car to the stadium I recommend adding extra time both ways to your planning.

Sheraton Palo Alto and Westin Palo Alto across El Camino Real from the stadium will have cheaper parking and food and drink available in their restaurants.

Uber/Lyft should be viable options as well but be prepared to wait in traffic and be patient.

17,Coldplay,stanford,1kzmgo3,Stanford 5/31 show will be my 11th time seeing them live.,"I've been fortunate enough to see my favorite band 10 times, the 11th being this Saturday as they kick off this leg of the tour. This time around, I am more aware of what a gift it is to be able to see them live. My first time seeing them live was on the Twisted Logic tour in 2005/2006, and Ive seen them on every tour since. 

I have to admit, that I think it's pretty cool to see them as their live shows have progressed through each tour. To my surprise, the last time I saw them when they were at Levi's stadium with the beginning of this tour, was actually the best concert I've seen from them. I had been to their previous stadium shows an knew what to expect, but there was something magical about the last time they were here. Maybe it surprised me cause I felt a bit disconnected with MOTS.   

  
This show I am going in with complete gratitude and going to enjoy every moment of it. I just want to soak it all in an enjoy the moment, because I know its going to go by in a blink of an eye!

MOTS was probably my least favorite album of theirs and as I felt a bit disconnected with it. But with Moon Music I felt an instant connection with it. I do think it feels a bit more personal and relatable.

I also think that with all this chatter from them about ""ending"" after 12 albums has me sort of looking back and just being grateful to be able to have found a favorite band that has been with me through this beautiful thing called life. 

I can't wait for tomorrow and I hope everyone has a great time this weekend with the two shows at Stanford Stadium! ",2025-05-30 18:36:11-08:00,alew2417,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coldplay/comments/1kzmgo3/stanford_531_show_will_be_my_11th_time_seeing/,19,11

76,Coldplay,stanford,1l5hdas,Tips for attending the upcoming Coldplay tour in the USA!,"Just got out of the Las Vegas show and it was fantastic!!

1. Get your shirts and gear early! They sold out of everything good and left us with scraps to grovel for. 

2. Check your stadium. Only clear bags. To store a purse it costs $20!

3. The schedule say 6pm and we foolishly came at 5pm and got in line. Coldplay didn't come out until 9pm!!! 

4. Get to the floor and stay in the pinch between the middle and left side close to the front stage.  That orientation is if you are facing the stage. Chris Martin spends the most time there.

5. Bring earplugs it gets really loud. Tinnitus is a real thing. Protect your ears.

6. Know your set list. They plays lots of new material with the more famous songs.

77,Coldplay,stanford,1l90val,Face value would be possible,"This screenshot shows the situation in Las Vegas shortly before sales closed on night 1, with a similar situation going on on night 2. Seating at or below face value, with several hundreds of unsold tckets remaining by the end. Why? Because fans refused to buy overpriced tckets, forcing scalpers to lower their prices by the end to avoid financial losses. This strategy only works if people hold out - the moment buyers give in to scalpers' prices, it doesn't work, there's no incentive for them to drop prices, as seen in Stanford and Denver.

This also applies to any additional tckets that Ticketmaster/Coldplay drops, some of which have been absurdly high, adapting to scalpers rates instead of being face value (aka dynamic pricing). Eventually, even those prices dropped.

Face value prices for reference:

* **USA**: Seating between around 68-228 USD, GA around 123 USD, Early Entry around 306 USD (with slight variations by venue)
* **Canada**: Seating between around 93-310 CAD, GA around 167 CAD, Early Entry around 416 CAD
* *(This is an estimate, based on the average of the official prices in other countries. However, for Canada, I know that GA was definitely $168 CAD, so it is a reliable estimate.)*
* *(In Canada, dynamic pricing seems to have partly been active during sales, leading to some official tckets priced above standard face value. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt pay those.)*
